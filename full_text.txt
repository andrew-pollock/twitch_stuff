a_n_i_v: Welcome in @tetsuoooo it was ok
SuperCaptainRob: I was offering to eat that for $696 but if you want to eat it for free go for it!
tm00n: Welcome in raidgers nikdudSmile
Metallichepe: welcome raiders
SuperCaptainRob: Thank you!
ShikisKhakis: also YOOOO NIIIIIIIIKKKKKKK!!!
SuperCaptainRob: We were having a debate about whether eating a whole tub of playdough would be worse on its own or mixed into a Subway Meatball Marinar
yawnegg: you can try a subdog üå≠ instead it's just as ass :)
ShikisKhakis: Nik's hats GOATED superc101PatPray
e_mcsqrd: I've been goin on the gym consistently from when i started university until now which has been about 20 years (ugh!!)
SuperCaptainRob: And stream was fantastic!  Hope yours has been great so far!
SerThiccems: shaund1FrogDance
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, the little cup
SerThiccems: HypeLUL
SerThiccems: I loved it
yawnegg: 5 dolla
TheMagicEel: a coke and a smile
SuperCaptainRob: Yep, playing Kingdom Hearts!  It's been fun.  I didn't think I'd like it going in but I've really enjoyed streaming it!
SerThiccems: Time to play KH
e_mcsqrd: any amount of money and then i'd donate it
history83: Playdough is too salty
yawnegg: lmaooo
SerThiccems: I mean KH do be enjoyable
e_mcsqrd: 100%.
history83: I might have when I was a kid
SuperCaptainRob: It just didn't seem like my type of game and I'm not really a big Disney person so the nostalgia factor wasn't a big appeal for me.
Metallichepe: i mean come on neek we were all kids
history83: look I never said I was a smart kid either
MR_CRASH87: playdough is very salty
SuperCaptainRob: lmao no they were not saying they would eat the playdough
ShikisKhakis: yeah if anything we were trying to talk rob out of eating it LUL
SuperCaptainRob: I've seen a lot of them.  The only Disney thing I REALLY love is Gravity Falls
a_n_i_v: teeeeeeebz
history83: glue
MR_CRASH87: a worm
TheMagicEel: here's a plan: host a casual party and put out soda and drinks but for food, deadass make the fake food things from playdough and just chomp in and start eating one
yawnegg: no no you don't understand üòÉ so if you mix the playdough in with another food it magically is fine to eat :)
ShikisKhakis: yawn LUL
SuperCaptainRob: Yep, Gravity Falls is Disney
TheMagicEel: playdough weenies with toothpicks in them, etc
TheMagicEel: have someone chomp in and eat, see if the others do it
TheMagicEel: peer pressure test LUL
yawnegg: LUL
history83: !ashamed
kojacktrick: !vomit
SuperCaptainRob: That was the big debate, was would it help if you added the playdough into a Meatball Sub.  I contended that spreading the cup throughout a sub would make it more tolerable, chat thought otherwise
e_mcsqrd: I'm curious as to what you ate as a kid lol
history83: so what did you eat as a Kid I am dying to know
TheMagicEel: LUL
ShikisKhakis: YESSSS NIK
kojacktrick: Haha thanks so much Nik! kojack6Huehue kojack6Jam
e_mcsqrd: @history83 great minds!
history83: @e_mcsqrd yep

TheMagicEel: looks tasty mang
TheMagicEel: nom nom
Metallichepe: !home
e_mcsqrd: i had to lick a soap bar when I was a young kid because I kept swearing lol
history83: @e_mcsqrd same
MR_CRASH87: tasty sponge so the grool from goosebumps
e_mcsqrd: oh...i remember.  it was gross
TheMagicEel: LUL i had a lady who made me wash my mouth out with soap as daycare, i did it and then said 'it's not that bad, bitch' LUL
TheMagicEel: memory unlocked thanks for reminding me @e_mcsqrd
history83: OMG Eel really
MR_CRASH87: yeah i came from beneath the sink episode lmao
TheMagicEel: she was ANCIENT
SuperCaptainRob: I may play some more KH down the line, but for now I'm just beating one.  I already want to beat all the Mainline Mario games, all the Donkey Kong Games, and all the Devil May Cry games.  I don't need to add KH on top of that ha ha
TheMagicEel: she was like 75 at least and i was 9 or so
history83: TBH I would be ok with it as long as my kid deserved it
e_mcsqrd: I also wasn't smart enough to know that if my parents couldnt see me, it didn't mean they couldn't hear me.  so when they left the room, I would walk up and down the stairs and say the F-word over and over again ...I was probably 5. I learned it from my sister.
TheMagicEel: hahahahaha
TheMagicEel: kids LOVE doing stuff they know they shouldn't
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, playing Mario Sunshine last year really ignited my love for Mario and there's some big ones i haven't played
SuperCaptainRob: Oooh, which franchises sound like fun to play through?
TheMagicEel: turn into a yakuza streamer
SerThiccems: oooo yakuza do be fun
SuperCaptainRob: Metroid would be cool and pretty doable
e_mcsqrd: oh they confronted me and said if i did it again, i'd have to lick the soap.  I didn't listen. lol
TheMagicEel: you'd be a GOAT metroid streamer
SuperCaptainRob: Yep!  I'm also really excited for Odyssey!  I've been saving it but I'm hyped
a_n_i_v: Are you wearing gloves for practicr?
SuperCaptainRob: That would be next level!

MinisterGold: yea so, i had people vote on games for me to play. People can vote multiple times for different games. Games with the most vote have the best chance of winning but are not guaranteed. So trying to make it so people can make an account and build their own gameslists for weighted voting
MinisterGold: tanks dude
MinisterGold: So back when I was accepting votes, they'd use channel points, and i would just enter it in manually. I don't think the app is particularly useful. Just using it as an excuse to practice my react and node
CptLongDongSilver: I am good, hands are full. 2 kiddos in my lap.

shakadactyl: Maybe when it becomes more affordable @baddiebec
SayYestotheJes: that sounds like it just rips your hairs out lmfao YOIKES
shakadactyl: Yes! It is a torture device and people unironically vouch for it.
baddiebec: @shakadactyl totally understand! if you can do it. I've been doing it for a few weeks and it's soooo nice
DaGummi: it can leave scars and open pores in the skin afterwards right?
history83: So close Nik but yet so far
shakadactyl: @baddiebec How long do you have to wait inbetween sessions? And how many will you need?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: would u get the dock for it nik...

Shaun_Da_Bomb: lol
shakadactyl: $400 doesn't sound too bad considering how much we spend on hair removal products.
shakadactyl: And if it's permanent...
baddiebec: right @shakadactyl !!  and I make it like cool. got a face mask on. some wine errorbHipe
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I didnt realize hair removal is that much
anotherMrEllis: listen, I've seen where the stockmarket is at, putting money into hair removal is not the worst investment right now

shakadactyl: @SayYestotheJes That would be hilarious/awesome
SayYestotheJes: @Shaun_Da_Bomb dude it can cost like $20+ for a brow wax
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I could sell a lot of my other handhelds to easily pay for the pocket and it would be a better experience

SerThiccems: I will never play this game
SayYestotheJes: i would never play this game
SayYestotheJes: @JhnMcDnld i am also VERY scared of the ocean
JhnMcDnld: @SayYestotheJes i hate it :(
SerThiccems: I am not scared of the ocean
SerThiccems: I am scared of those damn leviathan's
JhnMcDnld: im scared of my exes and the ocean, nothing else can stop me
JhnMcDnld: half joking
MinisterGold: how similar do you think space exploration is to underwater exploration minus the water part
SayYestotheJes: yes but i'm so scared of the ocean that watching this game can give me heart palpitations
SayYestotheJes: i'm trynna keep my heart healthy

SayYestotheJes: LUL if I stay awake, hell yeah brother
JhnMcDnld: (weed)
JhnMcDnld: i smoke the canadian flowers
SuperCaptainRob: I actually do find the controls in Galaxy a little disappointing.  They're not awful, but the last 3D Mario I played was Sunshine.  That one is so tight and has a lot of variety.  Galaxy doesn't have the dive at all and the backflip is /really/ finicky compared to other 3D Marios I've played
someguy_matt: wow this hack is really impressive
JhnMcDnld: @SuperCaptainRob yeeeee galaxy can be such a pain :(
someguy_matt: yeah
SayYestotheJes: MATTYYYY

SayYestotheJes: Nickel Ore, one of the raw materials in Subnautica, can usually be found in the Lost River, but it can also be located in the Inactive Lava Zone. When venturing into the Lost River biome there are a few areas that you should look at, including: Bone Fields. Tree Cove. Ghost Canyon.
someguy_matt: only if its off camera
someguy_matt: only because there was a reflection
SayYestotheJes: and it says kyanite is Inactive Lava Zone/Lava Lakes/Lava Castle
Ginger_Tech_: Yo! How goes the Subnatica!
Ginger_Tech_: It went well until OBS cut audio on me because of a minor disconnection.
Ginger_Tech_: I was about to end anyway, but...
MrCope: !needsit
Ginger_Tech_: Yeah, there was no reason to get going since I was going to end in the next few mins.
Ginger_Tech_: But I gotta figure out why that happens. OBS sees the audio, but twitch doesn't receive it for some reason.
Ginger_Tech_: It was! And it went well. We've made some good progress otherwise.
Ginger_Tech_: So, I do have it setup as certain tracks and that is possibility because supposedly those who use specific tracks this happens to as well.
Ginger_Tech_: Yes, all white mages.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: must resist... the urge... to hat... so I can OMEGA HYDRATE

MR_CRASH87: yeah so chill it'll make me fall asleep smacke5LoveGIF

MetalCrazy666: I'm 66hours into yakuza 6 and I still have a lot of shit to do KEKW
SayYestotheJes: i still jump scare, but not as easily LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @SerThiccems nikdudFine
someguy_matt: just remember that you're not getting scared because something is scary, you're getting scared because someone blasted an air horn in your ear
someguy_matt: @MetalCrazy666 That's every Yakuza game with good side content
raincoated: no its not
raincoated: rainco2Smug
SayYestotheJes: Nik, I lived with my parents/brother until I was 22. Then I lived alone-ish (in my grandparents' basement apartment). And THAT was bliss.

SayYestotheJes: not a horror girlie for realsies. i can read horror much better than i can consume it in other ways (games, movies)
SayYestotheJes: Blair Witch made me RAGE. They made ALL THE WRONG CHOICES for being in the woods!!!!!!!!!!!
MR_CRASH87: the kothoga is very creepy man. that thing is crazy

someguy_matt: whats up?
AndresTheUnicorn: We love Lightaligns here, and yeah, I only bought the game since I saw him play it loveso5Bongofrog
someguy_matt: i think i would end it with what i said in our chat earlier
someguy_matt: we started hanging out again and we're having a blast chilling
BennyKaPow: how's the castle treating you? which rooms have you gotten?
someguy_matt: but then halo went to the hospital
BennyKaPow: LightAligns? honest89GasmIntensifies kehzChefsKiss
BennyKaPow: also #teamhalo3
BennyKaPow: ghosts room is fun
someguy_matt: now it seems like he's on life support but his dad is pretending everything is fine
BennyKaPow: was ice/swim room in section 2?
BennyKaPow: that room is super hard. only beat it 2 or 3 times in runs
someguy_matt: am i wrong about that being the current state of halo tho
someguy_matt: i think it just needs more game classic halo game modes and maps
ErrorBorn: A battle royale mode could bring in some newbs ... I do love stomping noobs
someguy_matt: people only stopped cuz there was 3 game modes at launch and you coulnd't pick slayer
jellyfish_trifle: A think a BR is the only way for it to become mainstream again. The shift to F2P could have done that if they game had released in a better state.
someguy_matt: and like no maps
BennyKaPow: team slayer and team swat bennyk5HardYes honest89GasmIntensifies
ErrorBorn: Yeah we're too good clearly
someguy_matt: i don't think BR was needed
someguy_matt: cuz everyone was playing at launch
someguy_matt: it was just ruined by a lack of stuff
ErrorBorn: I try not to get salty about most things
ErrorBorn: Halo? They were close to 200K at launch
a_n_i_v: Batman
ErrorBorn: Now they're floating around like 7K? ... i think
e_mcsqrd: I'm a very salty and trash-talking competitive game player. as a result, i only play single player games lol
someguy_matt: @ErrorBorn that's just steam tho right
princesstrunks996: heyo all
someguy_matt: cuz you gotta factor in xbox pc and xbox console
MR_CRASH87: @princesstrunks996 hello there classi50Love

ErrorBorn: Fortnite had 1.6M active players in the last hour
someguy_matt: @jellyfish_trifle cuz the support has been ass
someguy_matt: i don't think you can compare any game to fork knife tho
jellyfish_trifle: Yeah, I think it had a real shot. I convinced lots of friends to try it, including PS guys who'd never played Halo before. But they all gave up and moved on
ErrorBorn: Sure ... but they didn't market Halo. Like I didn't even know it launched until a month after it was out ...
someguy_matt: it's like comparing a movies box office to avengers
diamondback_zero_one: Im doing Two's Complement calculations manually. please kill me

someguy_matt: i would love to go back to school just to get a doctorate in film just so people have to call me Dr. Someguy
SayYestotheJes: also, you know, i'd love to support my community more. working in child welfare makes you wanna do more and do better. or at least, it does for me.
SayYestotheJes: @someguy_matt omg I'll start a rumor that you have a doctorate and who wouldn't believe me?

SuperCaptainRob: Stream was fantastic!
SuperCaptainRob: lol you're good.  I played Pepsiman and I tried 12 different combinations of soda and milk and made a tier list
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, it's an event I've been planning for a while.  Just got soda on Amazon Fresh and Instacart ha ha
SuperCaptainRob: Definitely some interesting flavors, yeah.  Some really good, some not so much.  Shockingly none of them were really bad though.
SuperCaptainRob: Ha ha yeah, drinking a bunch of an awful one would've been a time
baddiebec: oh god yeah the NYE beer ü§Æ
someguy_matt: i had a bit of beer yesterday and it was poopoo
someguy_matt: it was the house beer for the place i went to with my buddies for my birthday
someguy_matt: but i also hate beer so not the best judge
SuperCaptainRob: Every now and again I pick up seaweed snacks hoping I'll like them this time since they're healthy.  But they always end up tasting really gross to me
history83: all beer is an acquired taste
SuperCaptainRob: They're like paper at first, but then they turn to a kind of gross mush.  The big issue though is that they really do taste like ocean water
someguy_matt: i think acquired taste is adult for bad but society does it so i have to too
baddiebec: cannot stand ittt
SuperCaptainRob: I really hate any kind of chewy meats, it's super offputting to me
raincoated: this is why i dont like bananas. the texture with that taste goes badge together
HometownTeam: The worst texture is coconut or oatmeal - anything mealy is yuck ü§¢
MetalCrazy666: I drink beer cause I like
MetalCrazy666: the buzz Kappa
SuperCaptainRob: I think with acquired tastes they often have something on the front which is strong and can be offputting.  But when you try them more you get past that taste on the front and start to notice the more subtler tastes playing around it and enjoying those
raincoated: I heard if youre allergic to latex then youre likely allergic to bananas. i think
FDotFDot: I personally don‚Äôt like anything with a grainy texture
HometownTeam: Like wet, flaky, mushy with flakes - it‚Äôs giving me a tummy ache just thinking about it
FDotFDot: Uhh
history83: yea that is cool
raincoated: SUSHIIII
someguy_matt: yes

someguy_matt: bring it
history83: yes we need to bring Dudge
SuperCaptainRob: I've never really been a sushi person.  I think my experiences with it when I was young weren't good (probably cause I grew up in Oklahoma and there wasn't a lot of good sushi there) and I just never went back to it
history83: I mean yea I will come and hang out
raincoated: HAHAHAHAH
baddiebec: ....I want sushi tbh....
MR_CRASH87: I love crab ü¶Ä
HometownTeam: You would have to  chase me around the block with some sushi
SuperCaptainRob: I'm 100% down for fried rice
a_n_i_v: thats wine?!?!?!
baddiebec: @a_n_i_v yeah it's good. wine is good

EyeOdin: the problem is Image packing
Ginger_Tech_: Python is actually super easy.
EyeOdin: Krita is a painting software
EyeOdin: a dot org program
Ginger_Tech_: I do.
EyeOdin: image packing is organizing images to make the set occupy the less space possible
Ginger_Tech_: Nothing terribly advanced, but I had a few classes and did some Minecraft modding with it.
EyeOdin: visual compression I guess. it usefull in the real world to ship stuff
Ginger_Tech_: Anyway, Headed out, gotta get some rest.
Ginger_Tech_: Ya'll have a good night@
EyeOdin: I made my own flavour to organize stuff

Shaun_Da_Bomb: Microsoft Paint
FDotFDot: yeye mspaint
FDotFDot: somegu34Dance
FDotFDot: I agree
EyeOdin: no AI here. I want to acctually learn how to illustrate. I make plugins to help me with it
LightAligns: I haven't used any personally
LightAligns: I have problems with ai art being used commercially personally
B2De81: ai is gonna mess up sampling laws even worse
LightAligns: but I'm not going to shove it down peoples throats
B2De81: musically
a_n_i_v: jaycBeer jaycPet jaycBeer
EyeOdin: human artists will be unemployed completley
B2De81: we'll have it soon, I'm sure
LightAligns: yeah, pretty much.
B2De81: the future is spooky
LightAligns: but also that you can prompt with artists names and it will emulate their style because it has been trained with their artwork
B2De81: as I shake my cane
BennyKaPow: I think AI art is just another tool to be used
EyeOdin: because Artstation was flooded with anti AI protests. Artstation is like where professionals show their portefolio and there are new AI artists literally shitting on others
LightAligns: there's a YouTube channel called dadabots that is ai music being trained on certain bands one month at a time
BennyKaPow: peeps were freaked about Photoshop and said it'd ruin art but here we are
FDotFDot: ehhhn
EyeOdin: Photoshop is a tool AI is literally a commision
cd0h: ^^^^
EyeOdin: there was a guy "employ me I am an AI artist and I can replace 20 of your artists"
EyeOdin: how can you be crappy when it is generating from Good Artists?
EyeOdin: LUL
BennyKaPow: ^ this mentality is because people are stupid not because AI art is bad
B2De81: $
raincoated: ai art IS bad
cd0h: if the painting has 6 fingers it's ai art LMAO
BennyKaPow: idk, imo it's like saying it's not music if it's auto tuned or uses synthesizers

MinisterGold: stfu aniv
SerThiccems: I am pretty good had some good dead by daylight games
SerThiccems: Ye I am dog shit at survivor tho
SerThiccems: pretty good at killer tho since the only real threat is flashlights and not death
jellyfish_trifle: @a_n_i_v Nik's doing his best, aniv
MinisterGold: also Nik. Yea dont play Morsel. I'm just confirming what you already believe
tm00n: bminutPanic bminutPanic bminutPanic

SerThiccems: I like the clicking
SerThiccems: thats just me tho
MinisterGold: do you have a compressor filter
LightAligns: it sounds a bit louder than it used to be, but not annoying
baddiebec: I don't mind the clicking
e_mcsqrd: i also like the clicking
MR_CRASH87: honestly the clicking relaxes me
MinisterGold: hmmm
Otakaru: @DaGummi gummi over here livin in 3023
e_mcsqrd: i have a funny condition that sounds evoke tastes...the clicking tastes like chocolate.
DaGummi: my neighbors can hear that typing
SerThiccems: Ugh music to my ears üò©üëå
LightAligns: nik over here hacking the planet
MinisterGold: i'll have to look at my filters again. I remember i revisited my mic, and one of the filters toned out the button noises
jellyfish_trifle: Are you using a typewriter?
LightAligns: synesthesia?
e_mcsqrd: it's 100% real.  mostly words have tastes...called lexical-gustatory synesthesia
history83: @jellyfish_trifle yes he is
e_mcsqrd: sometimes it's good lol. sometimes it's not (depends on the taste).  It's a pretty rare form of it.
LightAligns: I have a minor version of  something that's similar to synesthesia, but I know some other people with other forms
someguy_matt: poopoo
a_n_i_v: hello everyone
jellyfish_trifle: Hey aniv
MR_CRASH87: hey @a_n_i_v
baddiebec: Aniv... chill TF out
LightAligns: sin ah steez ee ah haha
tm00n: shaund1ShaunLeave
e_mcsqrd: i won't say the worst tasting words, but one of my favourite words is "example"...it tastes like butter pecan ice cream.
LightAligns: it's like sugondesia
baddiebec: now say Cilantro Kappa
e_mcsqrd: read, think or hear.
LightAligns: sugondesia nutz
someguy_matt: is that why people hate moist so much
e_mcsqrd: or say
tm00n: Cilahhhhntro
e_mcsqrd: a little bit like black licorice.
baddiebec: lepMONK
baddiebec: LUL
baddiebec: never heard of it
tm00n: I read a book about it in middle school I think
LightAligns: I had a friend who saw colors when music played.   another who saw every letter of the alphabet as a different color
e_mcsqrd: oh! @LightAligns your friend probably has perfect pitch???
LightAligns: he did actually.   and played violin.  i assume that's a comorbidity because of the visual cue
tm00n: It was called A Mango Shaped space. It made me cry
history83: I didnt notice it until you pointed it out. Now I cant unsee it shaking
e_mcsqrd: ya!  they researched me one of the universities.  I told them that I wish i had a useful form of synesthesia that would give me something like perfect pitch.
LightAligns: it means having one symptom or syndrome usually comes with another one.
history83: no it is all good
someguy_matt: so if someone says a word wrong does it taste like someone cooked something incorrectly?
tm00n: Quit and play sub naughty ca nikdudSmile
someguy_matt: Nik not finishing a game? never
baddiebec: yeah like when Nik says Cilantro I feel like Imma have food poisoning @someguy_matt
e_mcsqrd: nice question @someguy_matt !  It doesn't.  Every sound is different for taste.  but I get taste, texture and temperature.
DaGummi: WOOBLY keep it
someguy_matt: @e_mcsqrd that's super interesting

someguy_matt: @baddiebec behind a bed is a great place to hide if you can't be seen from the door
ErrorBorn: It was my favorite seen in Stargate

baddiebec: Nik won't live like a student for very long chat. I'm bringing my bedframe
history83: Matt Niks bed is just the mattress on the floor not a normal college boy
someguy_matt: cuz im a civilized person ya dingus
someguy_matt: @baddiebec good
ErrorBorn: Maybe Nik's bed just elevates with his virgin powers
ErrorBorn: No bed frame needed
history83: @baddiebec when do we get to see your shinning face on strim
MR_CRASH87: i have a bed frame and the ghost bought it for me

baddiebec: omg yeah @errorborn true......
someguy_matt: quickly Bec go scare him
history83: @baddiebec maybe HAHA
Otakaru: bed frame keeps you off your floor, if there was a gas leak or something the detectors are more likely to go off before it affects you if you are on a frame vs floor
Metallichepe: i understood what aniv said, aniv cool
someguy_matt: @a_n_i_v I come to say that I was saved?
baddiebec: @someguy_matt I did that Saturday and he's like my heart. and kept holding his chest LUL ma bad

ErrorBorn: Hell yeah brother BCWarrior
Metallichepe: @baddiebec plzzz barbGabnon
someguy_matt: gas leak
someguy_matt: storage
someguy_matt: to not be on the floor
baddiebec: @metallichepe nikdudSmile
baddiebec: Nik, the gas leak alone... like what else do you need for convincing?!
ErrorBorn: Will bed frames really save you from gas leaks tho?
ErrorBorn: From a dutch oven?
Otakaru: when you grow up nik your bones dont move the way they used to so getting up off the floor is harder than getting out of a bed
tm00n: ‚ÄúWhen you grow up‚Äù
tm00n: highli25Laugh
baddiebec: he's barely elevated folks tbh
Otakaru: @tm00n thanks for getting that otakarLul

parttimedogfish: I've got 90 minutes at work before I'm done for a week so pretty good!
betterCallSalt_: that's what she said?
history83: Here is what reddit said for the Ghost Leviathans.  If you're in a cyclops, just ahead-slow+silent running around the edges of where they're swimming. If they do attack, don't panic and use your defenses, and if all else fails, play dead->repair->start engines->decide on your exit strategy. The cyclops is sturdy and can take quite a bit of punishment.
JiyangSong: ohhhh hey, home base...named...uh...Bob
JiyangSong: Bob is a great name

parttimedogfish: I like hiking and cycling, and it is very compatible with those
StreaminLeeman: Salt LUL
StreaminLeeman: I think I like the faster weapons because I can dodge roll a lot better. I'm bad at blocking stuff so I'd rather roll
parttimedogfish: charge shit, and shit shouNotes
hockey_rocker10: Yes you do
StreaminLeeman: You just put up your shield, at least that's how it worked with the lance
hockey_rocker10: The reinforced suit I believe

hockey_rocker10: It‚Äôs just like the Xboxs but better
StreaminLeeman: midnightge
Otakaru: the fact that its not an xbox controller means its better Kappa
hockey_rocker10: It‚Äôs just more customizable
LaGrandePeche: Don't ask I don't know what is in your locker
hockey_rocker10: With the adaptive triggers which I like them in subnautica below zero
StreaminLeeman: braryPog Heck yeah

JiyangSong: i want that knift
JiyangSong: *knife
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Oh yeah Im fully aware of Peches love for LoU2 haha
LaGrandePeche: I think the last of us 2 is a masterpiece. Aside from a couple parts.
JiyangSong: ohai Shaun

LaGrandePeche: @Shaun_Da_Bomb you should try and play it again.

Shaun_Da_Bomb: @JiyangSong hey hey friendo!
hockey_rocker10: Yeah
someguy_matt: do you think its sequelitis with it?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I feel like LoU2 feels like Star Wars Ep. 8
JiyangSong: smifficJam
history83: !home
LaGrandePeche: The story telling and character development is amazing. In the LOU2
someguy_matt: the sequel doesn't feel as special because it wasn't your first time with the series so its less fresh
hockey_rocker10: Your definitely gonna need to have the reinforced suit to survive down in the lava zone
JiyangSong: yoooooo let's goooooooo
hockey_rocker10: Watch for that sea dragon too üò¨
someguy_matt: what did land ever do to you
StreaminLeeman: yoshiSTEER
hockey_rocker10: Use the bike on land it‚Äôs fun
baddiebec: yooooo
LaGrandePeche: Yes I did....I was skeptical as well. Like I understand why some people don't like it. If you can get past some things and just look at the game without a bias stand point, it's s tier. imo of course PrideCute
baddiebec: looks warm nikdudLove
parttimedogfish: looks like Walter White's lab
parttimedogfish: full of blue crystals
raincoated: yes
history83: yes
hockey_rocker10: Yes
LaGrandePeche: YES!
someguy_matt: what if you don't like it?
hockey_rocker10: Oh that‚Äôs not good
LaGrandePeche: @parttimedogfish yo wuddup homie
baddiebec: do. not die....
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean I compare it to ep 8 because it subverts your expectations in a lot of ways so some people applaud it for it... but I just really disliked almost all the characters lol but Im glad Peche is loving it
LaGrandePeche: @baddiebec wuddup homie g
Metallichepe: so this is how you gather kyanite , fuck i need this suit
hockey_rocker10: Need mk3
JiyangSong: are we gonna die?
baddiebec: @lagrandepeche pechyboiii hope you're doing well nikdudLove
parttimedogfish: @lagrandepeche shouHaj yo! how was the rest of stream?
a_n_i_v: MTG is better than agreed
HometownTeam: Fearless lol
MR_CRASH87: i beat the last of us
MR_CRASH87: but i never played the 2nd game
someguy_matt: i dunno why you wouldn't
LaGrandePeche: I would just play it nik you might like it. You might not. It's DEF worth a play!
someguy_matt: but what if you're like "guys im not having fun"
Landalin: nikdudHand
MetalCrazy666: nikdudHand nikdudHand nikdudHand
StreaminLeeman: nikdudHand
LaGrandePeche: You can borrow my PS4 if you want LUL
LaGrandePeche: I have both on there
Shaun_Da_Bomb: U dont think episode 8 didnt try subverting expectations? With how Luke is, Snoke, Rays back story... etc
Landalin: whats up legendary gamer nikdgedudge7dge
hockey_rocker10: They take your power
parttimedogfish: lava larva sucking your juice
Metallichepe: oooffff
hockey_rocker10: Use the shield to get them off
JiyangSong: again, i must ask..................are we gonna die?
LaGrandePeche: I was half joking LUL
Metallichepe: shouSTEER
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
JiyangSong: lol
LaGrandePeche: episode 8 just seemed lazy and uninspired imo
someguy_matt: didn't Ryan Johnson write it?
someguy_matt: or did he just direct it?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Rian Johnson... the dude that made a handful of movies and disney thought it was a great idea to have him direct one of the biggest franchise movies ever lol
ErrorBorn: !home
someguy_matt: @Shaun_Da_Bomb that's how we got the best thor movie
Metallichepe: neek how much longer are you gonna keep on strimming
a_n_i_v: I‚Äôm working on imyt?
someguy_matt: Disney actually does that a lot
Shaun_Da_Bomb: The problem is 8 was more interesting than 7 but the whiplash between 7 to 8 and 8 to 9 just makes the trilogy unwatchable
someguy_matt: they'll pluck someone who's made some solid smaller movies then toss them a fat budget
LaGrandePeche: nah fuck that call in and drop some acid!
JiyangSong: I mean, do you feel like going to the office tomorrow would enrich your life?
JiyangSong: yep!
hockey_rocker10: I like how they put things from below zero in the original subnautica
Landalin: Adam Driver was a pretty established actor but yeah star wars made him more of a bigger star
someguy_matt: think about it Nik
someguy_matt: im streming tomorrow
StreaminLeeman: Snow sholziMadge
HometownTeam: And people - the office has people.
baddiebec: yeah WFH Neek, so we can be distracted and watch Matt
Landalin: yo you smash your bros at the office sometimes?
Landalin: gnarly
HometownTeam: Oh - I don‚Äôt like the people part of the office. WFH is where it‚Äôs at for me
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Interesting doesnt equal good lol I just mean 7 was definitely a much safer movie. It was essential Ep 4 lol
JiyangSong: harrison ford literally got the role because his friend was like "oh hey, we need someone to read these characters for other people to audition against" and he did such a good job with Han Solo and got the role without even formally auditioning for it.
JiyangSong: or so the legend says
LaGrandePeche: Hot take Star Wars is garbo
Landalin: i liked the part where princess leah decided to become a spaceship
LaGrandePeche: I work from homer
ErrorBorn: nikdudHand
JiyangSong: yes, indiana jones came out 4 years later
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @JiyangSong Harrison Ford had made the movie American Graffiti and worked with Lucas on it
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Harrison starred in it
JiyangSong: oh hey!
a_n_i_v: There it is smcharBanger
JiyangSong: i forgot about that
Landalin: I am looking for a work from home job rn
ErrorBorn: Yeah it's usually pretty empty in the office.
HometownTeam: I‚Äôve been WFH since the start of the pandemic so April 2020 and I never want to work in the office every day ever again
ErrorBorn: There used to be like 70-80 people ... now it's like 12?
JiyangSong: i work from home.  i mean, i gotta go to the office once a week, but the rest of the week i'm home
JiyangSong: i love that knife, seriously
someguy_matt: the snow doesn't help
Shaun_Da_Bomb: American graffiti was I think Harrisons first big movie
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah its pretty good
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Not really an action movie
someguy_matt: guys i've been listening to the opening theme of KH2 so much since both Shaun and i are getting close to it
hockey_rocker10: Don‚Äôt know if you have the stuff for the reinforced suit but it‚Äôs blood oil in the blood kelp zone
someguy_matt: im so excited
HometownTeam: I‚Äôm less efficient at the office so I‚Äôm behind the day after
Landalin: KH2 poggies
JiyangSong: yee yee
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Its more of a film about kids hanging out in the 60s
Landalin: simple and clean more nostalgic for me
someguy_matt: i don't know if its a hot take but i think they get better with each game
JiyangSong: it's my...sanctuary, my sanctuary <3
hockey_rocker10: You need three of them
someguy_matt: Simple and Clean < Sanctuary < Don't Think Twice
MR_CRASH87: ghost organs
history83: BOOBA
JiyangSong: yeeyee, lyrics
HometownTeam: Your base is nice - you have a nice setup
Landalin: I definitely played way too many hours of KH2 grinding materials to max Soras attack stat for no real reason because game is easy anyway
Landalin: but i loved it
history83: yep
Landalin: did they add crouching to this game yet?
HometownTeam: Pinning stuff is from below zero - when did they put it here?
someguy_matt: you can grind out items that boost attaack
a_n_i_v: or is it just became friends will meet up with his videos were like "yeah it sucks
parttimedogfish: it's a shame they didn't add snapping to grid though
Landalin: you just farm material items from enemies and use the item synthesis
StreaminLeeman: Even when you say large I think you're doing a -ge word KEKW

jomyjomyy: deep sea
e_mcsqrd: deep sea...you'd live longer.  at least in deep space you'd die immediately
baddiebec: brb
MrCope: I'd aim for the sun
e_mcsqrd: oh damn.... deep sea still i think
MrCope: YEEEETTTT
e_mcsqrd: what would you pick?
MrCope: well in the documentary film, Sunshine...I think it took 26 months

e_mcsqrd: that's a terrile question @jomyjomyy .... ugh....i would duck.
MrCope: it's not lsrSad
e_mcsqrd: i figure...stomach acid would burn my face.
jomyjomyy: i think the smell of puke would be horrible, and if you duck you'll just get it on the way up. i'd probably just faint.
MrCope: Open wide. Power move.
e_mcsqrd: but....if you go into the barrel....would you not puke and you'd have to deal with both??
jomyjomyy: sushi
e_mcsqrd: oh chicken wings!
raincoated: CHICKEN WINGs
MrCope: kehzHmm too vague
MrCope: lsrActually the sushi is the rice
e_mcsqrd: spicy is my fav! bring it on!
MrCope: sorry tabasco is so rough on you
e_mcsqrd: did you have a problem with tabasco?
jomyjomyy: Oh man, I bought a rotisserie chicken today and bathed it in tabasco.
MrCope: Steve-O? what year is it
jomyjomyy: I used to grow scorpion peppers. I'm good with things up to about 2 million scovilles.
e_mcsqrd: hahahaha.  hilarious.  I get it...kinda like when i grab the 1 lb weights for my buddy that I work out with
MrCope: Sriracha? what year is it
jomyjomyy: it was in the small seaside town of Si Racha, Thailand in 1949 that resident Ms. Thanom Chakkapak first created this magical sauce, and named it after the town she lived in
jomyjomyy: ^just googled sriracha origins.
e_mcsqrd: i'm not a fan.
jomyjomyy: I think it's hells good in ramen
MrCope: it might be too much spice for you
MrCope: I only cried because you stabbed me in the hand with a fork because I laughed when you couldn't handle the spice
jomyjomyy: I have a friend who finds ketchup hot.
MrCope: very petty
e_mcsqrd: oooooo wow! so entertaining
jomyjomyy: ya, he breaks out in sweat
The_AmongUs_Guy_: hey Nik, hru?
jomyjomyy: i don't get it. there's like no capsaicin in ketchup

jomyjomyy: food poisoning sucks. wouldn't wish it on anyone.
The_AmongUs_Guy_: just something off in a pizza
MrCope: Sorry, the Legend of the Dragoon. Typo'd
e_mcsqrd: and how a pH of 1-2 in the stomach doesn't kill off some pathogens!!

SSVick: I'll eat some cereal then sleep
MR_CRASH87: hey bro

MR_CRASH87: i was sleep just woke up

jomyjomyy: nice
facebug: What‚Äôs poggy woggying my poggers?
facebug: Not yet I did dl it though
facebug: Last I played was linnea? It was good
someguy_matt: somegu34Hi
facebug: Just intermediate, light gimmicks, readable and fun
someguy_matt: doing good. was chilling with friends
someguy_matt: hows it going?
someguy_matt: just chilled
facebug: Yeah it‚Äôs new. Might be in waiting
a_n_i_v: nooooo he missed the snout of the playthrough
someguy_matt: what were you gusy playing last night. i got home at like 1:30 and was tired.
someguy_matt: what system do you want to play on/how old of a game are you willing to put with
facebug: Pls stop missing the snout
someguy_matt: lol i was going to say Awakening is the first one i played and is really solid
SSVick: first FE I playes was Awakening
someguy_matt: Engage has a bunch of throw backs so im not sure if you'll get as much out of it
someguy_matt: sadly its 3ds
SSVick: I would say so
someguy_matt: i'd say get a 3ds xl
someguy_matt: sorry
someguy_matt: new 3ds xl
facebug: I have the Mario maker 2ds
someguy_matt: the new 2ds xl is good but feels kinda cheap
SSVick: for switch you have Three Houses and Engage
facebug: That‚Äôs actually how I got my start in kaizo
someguy_matt: the new 3ds xl feels the best
someguy_matt: i'd say three houses then
SSVick: Warriors and Three Hopes are Musou style so keep away from them if you wanna start in FE LUL
SSVick: (in switch too)
someguy_matt: its prob the least fire emblme fire emblem
someguy_matt: but takes a lot of cues from persona
facebug: I used to have like all the castlevanias and ff  remakes and Mario kart aaand brain age
someguy_matt: like look up the opening cut scene for three houses
facebug: But no I watched stuff too like poo and ryu
someguy_matt: i was like oh shit when i first saw it
someguy_matt: just playing FE lol
someguy_matt: if the boys play something ill hop on discord
someguy_matt: nah i havent
someguy_matt: depends on the game
someguy_matt: its a tactics right
someguy_matt: advance wars like?
SSVick: strategy
someguy_matt: im surprised you haven't played FE Nik
someguy_matt: at least based off of how much you like FFT
raincoated: MATT
raincoated: macaro46Thicc macaro46Thicc macaro46Thicc
SSVick: eeveelPoint
someguy_matt: the only ones people played in NA before 3ds were GBA
someguy_matt: @raincoated RAIN
someguy_matt: somegu34Dance
someguy_matt: i like that tho
raincoated: lieforRave
TheUCanes: whut up
someguy_matt: feels good to beat a level on FE's hardest difficulty
someguy_matt: from awakening onward you can turn perma death on or off
TheUCanes: nah my life was consumed by czar
TheUCanes: i got a lot to catch up on
SSVick: FE Three houses and Engage you can go back X turns if you f it up
a_n_i_v: strykuCry
someguy_matt: its funny if you're playing on hard in three houses cuz you start out with 10 or something and a little before the mid point it goes up by a bunch
someguy_matt: and you're like oh im never going to use 15
someguy_matt: then shit get hard after the mid point
someguy_matt: and 15 very quickly becomes 3
someguy_matt: 10 rewinds
shakadactyl: What a cozy stream CoolStoryBob
someguy_matt: you have a limited number of rewinds
SSVick: to go back X turn
shakadactyl: How‚Äôs it going? SeemsGood I was supposed to schedule my tax appointment, but I, uh, didn‚Äôt, lol
SSVick: I think it goes up as you level your teacher level
someguy_matt: nah you can raise the number through some side stuff in three houses
someguy_matt: maddening is the hardest, i think you get less?
GiganticBucket: nikdudSmile Yo Nik, how ya doin?
n4rc01ep5y: n4rc01Party
someguy_matt: @SSVick do you know if you get less on maddening? i can't remember if you do
shakadactyl: It didn‚Äôt used to be hard. But I think over time our gov‚Äôt purposely made it more difficult. I had some tax crap from when I lived in Japan, so I had to get an accountant to deal with the headache
SSVick: I think you do
Landalin: got dang this is cozy
GiganticBucket: Fun hack IMO, how ya feeling about it?
shakadactyl: I envy Canadian tax season
SSVick: I remember having like 4 or something
Landalin: yoo what is this mario sprite i need lore
shakadactyl: I was an English teacher for two years
SSVick: I almost didnt use rewind for the last runs I did
someguy_matt: the rewinds feel like a lot before the mid point
Landalin: NOT THE CHILDREN
someguy_matt: then you start to panic
Landalin: i'm grinding pokemon violet now to try and get the greninja 7 star raid
Landalin: they do biweekly raids and thats the only chance you get to catch that pokemon
Landalin: and i was too noob to do the prior ones
shakadactyl: I speak enough to survive, but unfortunately, I live in an area where I get 0 use out of it. Would be surprised if I could hold a decent conversation anymore.
someguy_matt: @SSVick on maddening?
Landalin: nah no greninjas spawn in the world
GiganticBucket: Started watching Drink Masters, now making popcorn, then getting turbo cozy. nikdudLove
shakadactyl: Do it
SSVick: nice to see you, now I gotta go to sleep Bedge
Landalin: thats the point of the raids, to keep you invested and playing after you finish content
shakadactyl: Learn what they‚Äôre saying through osmosis
shakadactyl: Kanji is a PAIN. I feel ya
GiganticBucket: Competition show for high end bartending, lots of cool cocktail ideas.
Landalin: the best way to learn the language is to hear it and try and understand
Landalin: at least verbally
SSVick: @SSVick yeah last run I played was Golden Deer route in the hardest difficulty
shakadactyl: Application is important SeemsGood
GiganticBucket: Husband is really into it, I most enjoy tasting the results.
shakadactyl: I used DuoLingo for Italian
shakadactyl: Then got bored
Landalin: I know a good amount of spanish and i learn it mostly from practicing with native speakers rather than the 3 years i took in high school
someguy_matt: @SSVick nice. i've only beat maddening on deer. once on stream and once by myself
shakadactyl: Reading books in your target language is great!
someguy_matt: got two thirds into blue lions but it got very hard
GiganticBucket: Haven‚Äôt tried language learning as an adult. Doesn‚Äôt feel worth the investment since I don‚Äôt travel much‚Ä¶
shakadactyl: I wish I‚Äôd done it more when I was in my undergrad
shakadactyl: Manga is good too
someguy_matt: yeah there's three routes
Landalin: its not necessarily that they do a "bad job" but book learned spanish is very different from how its actually spoken, at least here in California where we have a lot of native Spanish speakers from mexico
shakadactyl: I forget all my Spanish from grade school LUL
SSVick: 4 routes + dlc
a_n_i_v: he was binge watch loard of that one
someguy_matt: lol yeah
e_mcsqrd: never too late! play piano!
Landalin: Get a saxophone I will give you free lessons
someguy_matt: FE needs a better title department

Landalin: 1-3k*
StreaminLeeman: Nah, it's still going, I don't think it'll be fixed until Monday LUL
someguy_matt: @StreaminLeeman somegu34Hi
StreaminLeeman: Matt! somegu34Dance
shakadactyl: Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself with Japanese. You ARE learning THREE writing systems.
StreaminLeeman: We actually went into the door and found where the speaker is because we were so annoyed at one point LUL
Landalin: fair enough they're expensive
StreaminLeeman: Thankfully I only had to stay at that desk until 6
StreaminLeeman: It was 4 hours of that tho KEKW
StreaminLeeman: I drowned it out with Youtube sound
shakadactyl: And even some of the Japanese people I lived and worked with couldn‚Äôt remember all the Kanji.
shakadactyl: It made me feel less bad.
Landalin: Mine is $2k but was a sick deal because this particular model was a very close competitor to the "holy grail" of saxophones that go for at least 6k, maybe 10 depending on condition
Landalin: EXIT THE DOOR
StreaminLeeman: KEKW
Landalin: Its not brass its woodwind but yeah I get you
shakadactyl: Lol, for Chinese, you have to know, like 50k. For Japanese, if you know 2k, you‚Äôre considered ‚Äúfluent.‚Äù But you can get buy with just 1k.
e_mcsqrd: it uses a reed. trumpet, trombone, etc. are brass
Landalin: brass is like trumpet, trombone, tuba, etc
e_mcsqrd: reed = woodwind
Landalin: yeah what e_mcsqrd said
Landalin: except flute
Landalin: flute has no reed but it is still a woodwind
e_mcsqrd: oh ya!! flute!  i forgot about that one lol
Landalin: no idea tbh
Landalin: but yeah woodwinds are saxophone, clarinet, flute
shakadactyl: Exactly! Language learning IS a lifelong process. The goal shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúto get fluent.‚Äù
StreaminLeeman: LUL
Landalin: and then you have double reeds like oboe and bassoon
StreaminLeeman: johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers
StreaminLeeman: I feel your pain dude, it's so hard to get thru an MGS run without a bathroom break LUL
e_mcsqrd: @Landalin is oboe woodwind?
shakadactyl: I told my students that all the time
StreaminLeeman: KEKW
StreaminLeeman: johnlu4Dance
Landalin: yes but a double reed woodwind
Landalin: i think
shakadactyl: Just because we‚Äôre native speakers of our respective mother tongues, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we know everything about it or are perfect.
Landalin: idk classification is ultimately arbitrary so who really cares
Landalin: "instrument sound good me like"
shakadactyl: Tbf, cilantro is a borrowed/loan word anyways, so LUL

someguy_matt: @Otakaru Father
Otakaru: @Otakaru otakarPog
Otakaru: just chillin

StreaminLeeman: GG deebicYay
KatMakes: HypeLurk
Landalin: vice city will always have that special place in my heart
StreaminLeeman: 5 has some really neat created game modes and stuff too
StreaminLeeman: Yeah, I wonder if they were careful with 4 because they didn't want to strain the 360/PS3
StreaminLeeman: Yeah, a lot of the race tracks and stuff are pretty sick
StreaminLeeman: Oh yeah you're right!
StreaminLeeman: I used to love that stuff
Landalin: honestly every progressive game in the series "SHOULD" be the best one

shakadactyl: I LOVED XII!
Landalin: it was fun i liked it, but gambit system made automating fights too easy for grinding
shakadactyl: Are the Dragon Quests game good?
Landalin: i don't like automating move tbh. kind of removes the point of play out fights imo. i want to figure out strategy, not have AI manipulate it for me
someguy_matt: really?
princesstrunks996: heyo all
jellyfish_trifle: Hey PT
shakadactyl: I have too many control issues to use the gambit system in FFXII
someguy_matt: what parts of DQXI made you feel strong emotions?
shakadactyl: Is Dragon Quest similar to Chrono Trigger?
princesstrunks996: im good ty hope ur well @NikDudeN7 @jellyfish_trifle
Landalin: especially with turn based stuff, not like there is any sort of mechanics element, so strategy is kind of the only point
someguy_matt: you can DM me if you don't want to spoil

king_omni: I've gotten to the second phase of Hades and died immediately
king_omni: I figured there would be because it's Hades, so there's bound to be some BS that happens
king_omni: I've only beaten Theses once, and that was the run that ended at Hades. I used the rail gun with the triple shot boon
king_omni: I only like that build because no reloading
king_omni: What boons do you have? The bow is doing absurd damage
king_omni: Oh yeah, followed by spear and shield
king_omni: I think so
king_omni: I've learn to never pick against Artemis. She is unforgiving.

ChuckG997: Hello hello!
ChuckG997: Heyoo @Shaun_Da_Bomb
MR_CRASH87: Welcome Raiders kikiswDankthomas
ChuckG997: This is my first playthru, tho I watched my wife play it so I know the story... we're trying to play along with the show
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Can confirm Chuck is the man!
ChuckG997: Yeah, tonight we played the events of ep6 from this past Sunday and next Monday we'll play ep7
jellyfish_trifle: @jellyfish_trifle You never forget your first! I think ER is a gentler introduction to the genre but you'll really struggle to go back to DS1 after it. They added a lot of QOL improvements between DS1 and ER.
MDarkGuard01: ladyve3Koalachainsaw  fun stream for tomorrow Kappa
ChuckG997: Yeah
ChuckG997: LUL @Shaun_Da_Bomb if you say so
ChuckG997: @MDarkGuard01 redeemed for me to play Visage tomorrow NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 bro you ride dirt bikes and own a bad ass sports car
ChuckG997: I have not played Subnautica but it looks awesome and it's on my list. I want to play it in VR
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Also, has great streams
StreaminLeeman: @jellyfish_trifle That is kind of what I'm thinking as well! Like I know the combat seems cleaner in ER but DS1 seems like such a fun experience to try. Plus I've been watching a couple people do hit-less and the bosses seem cool as hell
ChuckG997: I don't stream too many Horror games... I played Visage last halloween but didn't get all the way thru it
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 hes at the very end of the game so just a heads up
Metallichepe: im looking for the fungus and the bulb
ChuckG997: @Shaun_Da_Bomb Thanks for that, btw the next dirt bike video is gunna be awesome
Metallichepe: i mean bulb
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @jellyfish_trifle Im sorry I let u down in Halo brother
ChuckG997: Oh thank you, yeah I do wanna avoid them spoilers
ChuckG997: I was exhausted, and had other horror games I had to play
ChuckG997: Cool cool, I gotta run and get some stuff done anyway
jellyfish_trifle: @StreaminLeeman The interconnectivity of the world is still amazing but there's some stuff like long runs back to retry bosses that gets old quickly
ChuckG997: I've got a few redemptions in the queue, I'm also playing Fallout4 DLC right now
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 Im getting close to FF7 Kappa
Shaun_Da_Bomb: IMO Fallout 3
MDarkGuard01: You getting ready to shower Nik? Kappa
ChuckG997: I heard FO3 is the fan favorite, but I haven't played it yet
MR_CRASH87: Fallout 69 is great
StreaminLeeman: @jellyfish_trifle Oof Yeah I even noticed with Taurus Demon it was a bit of a walk, although I still get lost occasionally so that may have contributed LUL
jellyfish_trifle: @Shaun_Da_Bomb It's not your fault, Shaun. The OG Dream Team was too powerful to be left together Sadge
StreaminLeeman: I looooooved Fallout 3
baddiebec: !home
ChuckG997: Alright, I'm out of here, enjoy end of Subnautica!

a_n_i_v: You got this and that much time loss
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @MR_CRASH87 soooo Fallout 489?
MR_CRASH87: That‚Äôs perfect @shaun_da_bomb üëÄ
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Up to you homie!
MDarkGuard01: you getting scared? Kappa
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Id prefer a longer stream but if youre tired u can call it early
MR_CRASH87: The Last Of Us
MDarkGuard01: how about something good Kappa
ErrorBorn: Gal Gun
MDarkGuard01: not mario games Kappa

MR_CRASH87: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, The Last Of Us, & Dead Space
Metallichepe: ligma
StreaminLeeman: LUL
jellyfish_trifle: TLoU is good. Or Fallout.
StreaminLeeman: Each Phoenix Wright is prob around like 15-20 hours I think
StreaminLeeman: There's a trilogy collection on steam/modern consoles braryHypies
jellyfish_trifle: I think New Vegas has more interesting quests so probably more interesting to stream? But 3 is great too.
a_n_i_v: how hard it is :)
MR_CRASH87: Bro I probably came afterwards lol cause I never seen you stream that
StreaminLeeman: It's been a while so my memory is fuzzy but not crazy difficult imo

jellyfish_trifle: A variety streamer I follow played NV but I don't think the games have a big following on twitch these days
StreaminLeeman: sholziHmm Yes yes
MDarkGuard01: NotLikeThis
jellyfish_trifle: Just let one of the spooky sharks eat you. Then you can start again and don't have to pick a new game.

Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL Id rather not
StreaminLeeman: mx3Sip
StreaminLeeman: LUL
MDarkGuard01: to make you suffer, people enjoy that Kappa
ErrorBorn: Because I don't drink enough water so it makes me feel better when other people drink enough for me
MDarkGuard01: bc is nice seeing other people suffer? no? only me? okay Kappa
ErrorBorn: Idk ... I probably drink a cup that holds 30oz like twice a day
Shaun_Da_Bomb: WutFace
Shaun_Da_Bomb: "cute"

Landalin: yeah thats how honors classes were with me
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I was never in the same class with the same people
Shaun_Da_Bomb: My class had like 500 people in it
Landalin: I still play saxophone
Shaun_Da_Bomb: No my class lol
Landalin: it means his grade
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL it might have been closer to 400
KarishmaXX: yo üòÇüòÇüòÇ
MinisterGold: ah and yea i was in a new HS at the time, so i was in the first graduating class, so that was cool
Landalin: so like 12th grade had 500 people
Shaun_Da_Bomb: ^^^
MinisterGold: also, driving into my school looked like a prison
KarishmaXX: but how
KarishmaXX: that has to be american
MinisterGold: Yo Shaun minist22HatWave
Shaun_Da_Bomb: What up Goldddddd
MR_CRASH87: My high school looked like an assembly building
Shaun_Da_Bomb: We only had 1 highschool
Landalin: yeah we call our graduating year "class of 2010" or whatever
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL we call the course a class haha
KarishmaXX: so thats why teachers cant focus on their students
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I SEEEEEEEEEE
KarishmaXX: ohh so u mean the entire grade is called a class
MinisterGold: this is getting less confusing fast
Landalin: yes
baddiebec: LUL @karishmaxx

Shaun_Da_Bomb: No no no so general years were called grades
KarishmaXX: but diff classes
Shaun_Da_Bomb: But I was specifically just talking about my graduating CLASS
KarishmaXX: like 20 classes for 1 grade
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
baddiebec: LUL
Landalin: then what do you call your scores that you get in your class? grades have 2 meaning then too
HometownTeam: Leave it to the Canadians to make us feel weird! ü§£ü§£üòÇ JK
baddiebec: Merica lepS
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean technically but people dont say 11th class they say 11th grade. Class is specifically just the year you graduate lol
HometownTeam: Is first year not Freshman year?!
Otakaru: nik there are new people in grade 9 every year. so the people you move with to year 10 are part of your graduating class
Landalin: @HometownTeam yes for us mericans

Shaun_Da_Bomb: Softman was my least favorite year
KarishmaXX: üòÇüòÇ
baddiebec: LMAO @karishmaxx you're killing meee
HometownTeam: School is BS - tell that to my student loans
MR_CRASH87: I can‚Äôt stop laughing softman
baddiebec: when I hear junior I do think 1st year
Landalin: i usually take my shoes off in the house
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Sometimes
someguy_matt: and if you wear your shoes inside where do you take them off
someguy_matt: where's the line
Shaun_Da_Bomb: In my own house I take them off
Landalin: but fresh man. as in fresh and new
LightAligns: we wear house shoes in houses.  but we drive on parkways and park in driveways
e_mcsqrd: when I was a first year medical resident, i was a junior
HometownTeam: Junior is less than senior
KarishmaXX: when Justin Bieber first moved to states they asked him if he eas a softmore or what and he had no idea how to answer
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I feel like it would be weird going over to someones house and just take them off unless they kind of bring up that I can leave them somewhere
Otakaru: i think junior/senior are relics from when only grades 11 and 12 were considered high school
Landalin: glad to learn some Bieber lore
Landalin: I just take my shoes off right at the door to not track in mess into the house
KarishmaXX: is it bc it doesnt snow in the states thats why they wear their shoes inside
KarishmaXX: is inside always dusty then??
HometownTeam: Wait! @otakaru high school used to only be juniors and seniors?!
baddiebec: it snows in American @karishmaxx lepPRAY
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @HometownTeam Thats correct
Landalin: In American
baddiebec: IM STRESSED OK @landalin LUL LUL
HometownTeam: I gotta Google that because it is news!
Landalin: Nik you walk around stepping in shit all the time or what?
a_n_i_v: where are the patch notes bro
someguy_matt: i would always hear parents asked who tracked mud into the house in shows
baddiebec: @a_n_i_v exactly
HometownTeam: Yes
LightAligns: listen.  you have to build up immunities somehow.  just track all that garbage into your house
someguy_matt: and i was always like who the fuck is wearing their shoes inside
Otakaru: @HometownTeam we don't need facts to tell nik stories Kappa
LightAligns: put your feet up on the kitchen counter with shoes on
baddiebec: @lightaligns Imma cry
Shaun_Da_Bomb: So okay... if u were going over to someones house that u dont know well... u still take your shoes off going to their house?
Landalin: you saying fecal matter is killing me
someguy_matt: yes
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah... idk
LightAligns: not to mention how old I am, but I wear slippers inside haha.  but I don't wear shoes inside
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Definitely not that way here
HometownTeam: I don‚Äôt wear shoes in the house at all - and I don‚Äôt have people over that don‚Äôt take theirs off
KarishmaXX: when i saw american shows wearing shoes inside i thought it was fake until i started watching american lives on IG
someguy_matt: maybe canadians don't have foot fetishes so its not weird exposing the puppers
Shaun_Da_Bomb: What if u go to a house party?
KarishmaXX: also why does it matter how well u know someone whether u take ur shoes off
Landalin: It also might differ from state to state. cause everywhere I go everyone takes off their shoes
someguy_matt: you know how shittly the floor would be in the winter if we left our shoes on
KarishmaXX: and yes if theres a house party u still take them off
baddiebec: @shaun_da_bomb you take them off. pile em on top of them lol
LightAligns: depends on the house party
someguy_matt: yeah i take them off
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @LightAligns KEKW
Landalin: cause what if they're gonna steal your shoes at the party bro?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Because I feel like its almost like, literally "making yourself at home" if u take youre shoes off
KarishmaXX: if ur trashing the house leave shoes on
baddiebec: I wear a size 4in kids so so one touching ma shoes LUL
SayYestotheJes: 12 raiders from SayYestotheJes have joined!

KarishmaXX: LMFOAOAOAAO
history83: Hey Bec I have been lurking while playing games so I am in and out
KarishmaXX: LOL YES TO JESS
HometownTeam: Filters for sure @karishmaxx - you couldn‚Äôt pay me to drink tap water

SayYestotheJes: but here in East TN, I can't drink our tap water BLECH
KarishmaXX: whoooaa memphiss waterr
KarishmaXX: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
HometownTeam: Cryptosporidium is a bacteria that makes you have to boil your water before any kind of use
shakadactyl: My old school used well water. It had a sweet aftertaste to it.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Na in the instance where like, obviously the shoes are gonna make a mess then yes we take them off lol
history83: @KarishmaXX If you live in a state that has snow you take your shoes off when you get in the house here in the states
LightAligns: memphis water is definitely some of the cleanest in the us.  actually tastes different
Landalin: @HometownTeam sounds like a crypto shitcoin

MetalCrazy666: ajsDoc ajsDoc ajsDoc
KarishmaXX: but i wanna know abt the canada and states differences
Landalin: what no i put it in my pocket
baddiebec: @lightaligns in your mouth?!?! whyyy
LightAligns: I don't.   I see people do it
shakadactyl: But in all seriousness, the well was covered. Not just left out for anyone to dump crap in.
KarishmaXX: Lightalifbs
history83: @LightAligns no that is why you get slip on shoes
KarishmaXX: lightaligns
LightAligns: same with money.  fucking disgusts me
baddiebec: @lightaligns thank god I panicked for a min
KarishmaXX: thats hard no unless u sanitize ur phone everyday
KarishmaXX: i put it between my legs
history83: Here is a question all! Do you use your phone while in a public restroom?
LightAligns: I prefer my e coli directly from a petrie dish
KarishmaXX: LOL
HometownTeam: I try to never use a public bathroom
baddiebec: same @karishmaxx
Landalin: with sound off sure history
baddiebec: LUL yo sameeee @hometownteam
KarishmaXX: i try not to use my phone in public washrooms but thats personal i feel like most ppl dont care how gross it is
shakadactyl: WutFace
history83: @Landalin really why? I am asking not judging promise
e_mcsqrd: i've heard smarties are the same thing as rockets in the states
MetalCrazy666: Here's a diference from Portugal to USA, Spain, France, Germany, etc. Most of these countries dub everything: movies are dubbed to their language, games are dubbed, anime is dubbed. In Portugal we don't have dub culture, we only dub kids cartoons and shows, cause most may not know how to read
MR_CRASH87: Public bathrooms are a nightmare
KarishmaXX: no wayyy thats interesting
MetalCrazy666: So I can't watch dubs cause I'm not used to it, I watch everything in OG language
baddiebec: Nik you literally used a public bathrm on Sunday Kappa
shakadactyl: You guys are squatters in an old building? Keepo
MR_CRASH87: Abandoned? That‚Äôs creepy
baddiebec: guys. is it bathroom or restroom?
history83: Wait Nik if there is no one else in the building is there a cleaning crew that cleans the other levels?
KarishmaXX: GOOD Q BADDIE
HometownTeam: It‚Äôs ok for guys to use public bathrooms but we have to sit down and that‚Äôs just NO
MetalCrazy666: Subs NODDERS
KarishmaXX: in canada we say washroom
baddiebec: THANKSSSS KARISH
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Washroom...
MR_CRASH87: I say public restroom
history83: @HometownTeam what about portajohns?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I randomly switch between restroom and bathroom
shakadactyl: Because there used to be chairs where you could sit and chill Kappa
KarishmaXX: mr crash 4 syllables just to go pee
HometownTeam: I would rather pee on myself @history83
KarishmaXX: PORTAJOHNS üòÇ
HometownTeam: I‚Äôd still be cleaner
history83: @HometownTeam HAHA
history83: @KarishmaXX yes it is a portable toilet that is used outside
MR_CRASH87: @karishmaxx piss in every toilet üöΩ yes
a_n_i_v: it's only insecurity with that strat though
shakadactyl: "The term restroom came from the fact that in early 1900s up-scale restaurants, theatres and performing facilities would often have comfortable chairs or sofas located within or in a room directly adjacent to the actual toilet and sink facilities. Technically people do rest there because they are sitting down."
KarishmaXX: we call portajohns "portapotties""
baddiebec: I think I say bathroom...?
Otakaru: bowser
KarishmaXX: whoaa cool to know
shakadactyl: Some places where I live still have sitting rooms in the restrooms
MR_CRASH87: That‚Äôs interesting
history83: @KarishmaXX oh yea they are interchangeable for sure

boozie703: Glow in the dark blankets for kids!!!!!‚Ä¶. I think we are going into business together.
gr8fulAF: last smash I played religiously was 64
gr8fulAF: that's personal D: lol
history83: I would think that blanket would keep the kids awake.

LightAligns: Short version of one - had a band room that was shared with others.  One guy from a band called demonic prophesy used to try and summon stuff in the room before their practices.  One night during a break between songs when it was quiet with no vibrations, a stack of cds that were on the table just flew across the room
MDarkGuard01: ah yes only google Kappa
MDarkGuard01: sure Kappa

home_wrecker: @ShadowPandaaaa PogBones
MDarkGuard01: Yes it works, is like one of the tips for going camping at night, what else is there just small animals
ShadowPandaaaa: HI HOME
home_wrecker: hello Panda
MR_CRASH87: camping is fun as long as i dont see a big ass grizzly bear or wolves
baddiebec: I don't know if I'd be scared of camping. I just don't like bugs and dirt
a_n_i_v: What good in my house

gorpo_c: it was very good. i had a ton of fun
MDarkGuard01: just be a man and grab a knife Kappa
ShadowPandaaaa: youd be very hydrated
MR_CRASH87: the white patch they have near their eyes freaks me out not to mention how big they're and how fast they swim. Free Willy even creeps me out and that was a family movie LUL
ShadowPandaaaa: naaahhh
ShadowPandaaaa: youre suppose to drink like 1/3 your body weight in water
LightAligns: Another short story.  Went camping in a forest called happy valley in Central NY.  We got a bad feeling at like 2 and decided to leave.   Tried to drive our car out and there and all the lights in my car started dimming and getting bright.  Car almost died a couple times and as soon as we pulled out onto the road it went back to normal
gorpo_c: nah i don't think so
Metallichepe: jesus lights
MDarkGuard01: sounds like a battery problem Kappa
MDarkGuard01: maybe getting cold Kappa
MR_CRASH87: that's creepy
history83: @LightAligns that is where you roll down the window and shout at the top of your lungs "NOT TODAY SATAIN" and they will leave you alone
baddiebec: LUL History
history83: BRB
history83: that was how I got one to leave our house several years agao
saela253: almost there
MDarkGuard01: and you get the cops behind you, and ask you to do an alcohol test Kappa
ShadowPandaaaa: drink all the water
ShadowPandaaaa: gotta water the plant
baddiebec: LUL panda just wants to make sure you're always hydrated
MDarkGuard01: to have nice effects?
ShadowPandaaaa: crying for your losses
baddiebec: panda. In the summer, do you want me to get Nik to put the plant hat on. Then go outside and I'll throw a water balloon at him?
LightAligns: There are a few droplets throughout the level
MR_CRASH87: the more you drink the more you'll take a piss in the haunted toilet
baddiebec: nikdudSmile nikdudSmile nikdudSmile nikdudSmile
baddiebec: !plant
baddiebec: I'm already mad now
baddiebec: "don't be mad" Kappa
LightAligns: Get him one of those kiddie pools and paint it like a pipe

MDarkGuard01: WutFace
baddiebec: I'll get those rocket launcher style waterguns

MR_CRASH87: would you actually do one ahaha
baddiebec: You'll agree. lepEVIL
LightAligns: I can't remember who I raided once who was in a hottub outside playing Waterworld haha
LightAligns: Haha that's right.   So good
baddiebec: LUL
ShadowPandaaaa: BEC
LightAligns: Speaking of other hacks, I think you played Waterworld right?
LightAligns: Did you play boogie wonderland?
ShadowPandaaaa: i sent you the best thing
baddiebec: PANDA LUL finding those links sooo quickly
LightAligns: Oh you should play Waterworld then
a_n_i_v: @RyuVincent peepoLost
LightAligns: Add it to the list anyway
ShadowPandaaaa: there are reusable waterbaloons
MDarkGuard01: is it based on the movie, waterworld? Kappa
LightAligns: Void or Waterworld would be my recs
saela253: im laughing already
history83: WOW aniv out here calling people out saying that they are lost and shit
LightAligns: lighta8Sip
history83: that burrito was as big as my forearm and I legit devoured it.  So good
LightAligns: I was sipping at saela's chat line above Mr if it's what I'm thinking
LightAligns: *me
history83: It is as long as my foot
history83: I dont know how long my arm is sorry
saela253: it is
MR_CRASH87: !home
baddiebec: Brb! Going into lurk
history83: I posted a picture in discord Nik of my forearm
history83: No it is not
history83: do you now
history83: how cool is that
history83: I am thinking of getting some tattoo's on my arm some time soon
LightAligns: I can tell you it's not that haha
saela253: you have to play all exits again but with low gravity
history83: umm I want to do a tribute to my grandmother's and grandfather's
LightAligns: I don't think you found the pressure water hidden level in this yet though
tm00n: Bowsieeeeeeee
tm00n: winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE
history83: I know for one grandma would be flowers, maybe a breast cancer ribbon for the other grandma
saela253: i really can't stop thinking about a low gravity level with this asm
saela253: people might lose their minds
LightAligns: Kappa
history83: for my grandfathers I would do an Airforce tattoo and an Army tatttoo
tm00n: It‚Äôs been a goodge day. How are you neek dewd?
history83: Hi Moon
saela253: yeah but...low gravity where you have to do all the inputs
saela253: ?
MR_CRASH87: ello @tm00n :D HeyGuys
saela253: that should be pretty fucked
tm00n: @history83 highli25Wave
history83: Hey Nik do you not see that door right next to you at the start point?
LightAligns: It's an input playback level where you actually jump anytime you let go of jump instead of pressing jump
tm00n: @mr_crash87 nikdudHand nikdudHand
history83: oh ok
saela253: my god light
tm00n: Not much today. I worked hella early and then played AC all day
saela253: that actually sounds fun
LightAligns: Regrabs are done by not holding jump
history83: how fun is that Moon the whole playing AC all day
LightAligns: It depends.   Cursed where it's still fun?  Or just cursed where people would hate us?
saela253: disco riding to the left with reverse controls
LightAligns: You just let go of the button completely to do a full jump
tm00n: Today it was tedious cause my inventory is nearly full so I spend most of the day sifting through all of my hoarded shit seeing what I could get rid of
LightAligns: We have joked about cursed where people would hate us.   I'd have to look for old ideas haha
saela253: we had some pretty messed up ideas
a_n_i_v: Ty is crushing of tea  after i finish this and bloodlines fit in that train of thought turbo was cheating so uh yeah you must‚Äôve picked up upon acquiring these fools the trader joes burrito atm
history83: ok then aniv
tm00n: Buncha furniture
LightAligns: We did have a setup with 1f0s and and noteblocks where the key you would have to ride to beat the level moved at about..  a pixel a second
LightAligns: We actually have a discord channel with level ideas for that hack hahaha
tm00n: I can send you things Nik but you gotta add me as your best friendge
saela253: i had an idea once of mario not being able to jump and there would be two mega moles next to each other walking right....and it would be ice physics....so you would have to to run left and right on the moles to avoid shit falling from the sky.....problem was it was too easy to fall down inbetween the moles
LightAligns: It's like a a healthy outlet for ridiculous ideas
LightAligns: We also had a level idea where every sprite was resigned to be a different sprite.  So you couldn't rely on regular jumps or spin jumps anymore to jump off them
LightAligns: And another that was just named "oops, all spritekillers"
saela253: actually the original idea for road not taken would have been pretty cursed too
LightAligns: Yeah, and we almost did that haha
saela253: final level of ascension
LightAligns: I mean... Ascension 1.0 water level was pretty cursed according to some
tm00n: Well I‚Äôm at the point in the DLC where I can customize my villagers houses on my actual island so I‚Äôve been doing those
jellyfish_trifle: jellyfish_trifle gifted a Tier 1 sub to a_n_i_v! They have given 3 Gift Subs in the channel! 
ShadowPandaaaa: Cheer100
LightAligns: I would say like JUMP or team shell?
BaggageID: howdy dude! minist22HatWave
jellyfish_trifle: It's an investment in my relationship with our future overlords
tm00n: You gotta do hella vacation houses for that
tm00n: But yea
BaggageID: can't sleep adisacSadge
BaggageID: cet

BaggageID: GG salt! superc101PatGG
betterCallSalt_: bomby boi!
betterCallSalt_: Thanks!!
BaggageID: in around four hours - I hope I fall asleep soon :D
LightAligns: Oh we also had an idea for a precision swimming level where each door sent you to a random room, but the d pad controls were different for each one
BaggageID: I am a university student - so I don't work-work
saela253: one of the rooms should also have automatic fast swim
ratatremy: Yo @NikDudeN7
saela253: oh yes
eejay: @LightAligns barbStare
LightAligns: Also timed on/off mechanism that changes your d pad controls
LightAligns: See.   We hold back
BaggageID: not really a program, I just need to get up to get in my personal schedule for studying - I don't want to start too late. Also I am studying politics dangilStudy what do you do?
betterCallSalt_: @eejay are you ready for another 6000 second timeout?
eejay: only 10 minutes? sure
betterCallSalt_: SeemsGood
e_e_j_a_y: o7
betterCallSalt_: o7
betterCallSalt_: no LUL
BaggageID: like gold! dangilChat
BaggageID: I think o7 is better than o/ because the second one kinda looks wrong dangilSweat
eejay: v! eejayPls
LightAligns: That's like mirc and usenet stuff
BaggageID: What is the origin of o7? According to Crossing Zebras, these were created from a need in the game EVE to communicate and be personable. It is assumed that the other players will be threatening, so a need for nice communication was born. This is also used in other games like Elite Dangerous. thilda1Nerd
tm00n: Sorry neek we had to give the baby kitty an emergency bath
BaggageID: looks like EVE is from 2003, Elite Dangerous apparently from 2014
MR_CRASH87: !home
saela253: can't be the hack
MR_CRASH87: think i just woke myself up ahaha glad im off work tomorrow and Thursday
LightAligns: Just look at it.   This is beginner kaizo
saela253: this is standard
LightAligns: Does it still feel like a big victory every h or goal?
BaggageID: I'll give sleeping another try - have a fun rest of the stream and I hope you get the inputs right!  minist22HatWave
MR_CRASH87: i pay attention to your eye movement oddly lmao
tm00n: My boyfriend has a kitten. He‚Äôs very naughty
LightAligns: I was haha
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Counting sheep? KEKW
LightAligns: That joke about "it's not hard.  Just press the right buttons at the right time" kind of has a new meaning in this hack
MR_CRASH87: yeah LUL
tm00n: He‚Äôs goodge. Never had to give a kitten a bath before highli25Laugh
a_n_i_v: It's a "Stuff You Should Know! LUL

boozie703: Yup.
boozie703: I do it in the morning too.

LightAligns: I have like 6 alarms set in the morning.   My wife hates me
boozie703: Saela with the slopcoHuh energy

history83: Cheer200  Sweet dreams are made of cheese. Who am I to dis a brie? I Cheddar the world and the Feta cheese. Everybody‚Äôs looking for Stilton. I stole this from someone else's stream it was too good not to share.
MR_CRASH87: you go to bed early then you wake up early lol
Metallichepe: pugPls
LightAligns: We used to take turns setting random songs as our alarm clock in the morning
history83: and now I will not be able to sing that song correctly ever
boozie703: I literally don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôm snoozing. And wake up 1.5 hours later
saela253: I used to have songs i liked as alarms but of course you end up hating those songs
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @history83 The Marilyn Manson version was so good
history83: @history83 yes it was
boozie703: Almost every morning
LightAligns: Exactly.   You end up hating the songs.  So then we set stupid songs we hated but then you wake up in a bad mood
MR_CRASH87: FETA CHEESE enritaHEART enritaHEART enritaHEART
LightAligns: There was some death metal once in a while.
saela253: I do yeah
saela253: No snooze
MR_CRASH87: strangely i don't need an alarm to get up
history83: dude I have a real alarm on my phone to wake me up.  I also have two times set and I snooze at least 5 times each
boozie703: How compos3
Otakaru: when i had a commute i needed 3 alarms to get my ass up. since i started working from home I don't need it anymore
a_n_i_v: Havoc honest89Salute
boozie703: honest89Salute
history83: my first alarm is set for 425am then 435am and I dont get out of bed until 445am to leave the house by 510am
MR_CRASH87: im a morning person im usually up before 7am sometimes
saela253: I have my alarm set at a time where i just have to get up otherwise I'll be late
LightAligns: Three jumps from freedom
Otakaru: 45 min to an hour depending on traffic
history83: mine stated the same at about 25mins to 30mins depending on traffic
LightAligns: I already worked from home, but I used to have an hour commute one way

Dynamic_Gravity: lets gooo
Shaun_Da_Bomb: The thing is...
a_n_i_v: LUL LUL LUL LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I feel like nothing unique has really come out
Otakaru: @Shaun_Da_Bomb you arent interested in Dr Disrespect's NFT game?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Like Halo 3 felt like halo but still felt fresh
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Gears of War was completely unique
Shaun_Da_Bomb: At the time
MR_CRASH87: Can‚Äôt wait for Mortal Kombat 12
Dynamic_Gravity: I been BUSY. But well. Finally got some gummies so I can chill tf out and not have so much anxiety. Life is good. How've you been Nik?

EyeOdin: but I gave up too stressfull
Dynamic_Gravity: Haven't taken one tonight, school night xD but this weekend for sure. Gonna see god for sure
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean I used to play CSGO and I find it to be less "Hardcore" than that sorta
EyeOdin: nah I suck so much now
Shaun_Da_Bomb: As far as gun mechanics go
EyeOdin: I wish i could go to Evo
EyeOdin: that would be a dream
EyeOdin: just watching would be awesome already
EyeOdin: I live in Portugal
Shaun_Da_Bomb: ID love to go to GDQ

EyeOdin: nah I dont have level
EyeOdin: Maximilian is not that good
Dynamic_Gravity: @Shaun_Da_Bomb But you're like 50?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Its basically done
EyeOdin: but old age slows down everything
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Maximillian is awesome tho
Shaun_Da_Bomb: But yeah definitely not pro
Shaun_Da_Bomb: He makes great content across the board
EyeOdin: I think people just think he is entertainning
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Been huge in the fighting scene in general
Shaun_Da_Bomb: He got pretty big from goofy Youtube skits back in the day
Dynamic_Gravity: wait, are you having to migrate all the e2e tests to the new framework? jesus
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah I watched his reaction to the capcom show today live
Dynamic_Gravity: the plan is to find a new job
MR_CRASH87: i like maximilian dood
EyeOdin: for what I see on youtube "Brian_F" is acctually good for what I see
Dynamic_Gravity: omg react breaks every new major release where the deprecate then reintroduce then redeprecate the deprecate
EyeOdin: Maximilain has been around for ages
EyeOdin: must be older than me
Dynamic_Gravity: our prod app still runs fucking jquery...
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Exoprimal release date, monster hunter rise sunbreak is coming to ps and xbox, sf6 stuff
Dynamic_Gravity: ;-;
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I think thats about it
MR_CRASH87: i like watching max's MK11 event he went to
MR_CRASH87: the reveal event
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Exoprimal is the game where u fight waves of dinosaurs against another team online I think
MR_CRASH87: yeah that event was HUGE man
EyeOdin: if I could make a fighting game I would make something so cool. I have notes for one for ages
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Not just 1 dinosaur
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Multiple
Shaun_Da_Bomb: U know whats better than 3 dinosaurs?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: 4...

MR_CRASH87: just like mortal kombat just with all the horror characters only like candyman jeepers creepers pennywise hellraiser
EyeOdin: but I am not making a fighting game first
EyeOdin: need to make easyer game
EyeOdin: platformer
Dynamic_Gravity: did a cursory google, enzyme to react-testing doesn't look awesome. Just mostly skip the wrapper and instead es6 imports the specific context so you should be fine
Dynamic_Gravity: *doesn't look awful

We were so close to not having to deal with fragmentation in the way browsers render but they ended up going their separate ways.

TheUCanes: see this is why i like you TW
ThirdWall: Left hand milk stout is a classic
jellyfish_trifle: I don't *drink* 5 a day. I have 5 fruit or veg a day. And cider is just apple juice, so it counts as 1.
TheUCanes: Founders Breakfast stout is good
FDotFDot: KEKW
FDotFDot: cd0hDAB we.....

someguy_matt: people hate it when things are different
ThirdWall: This was devastating
ThirdWall: https://clips.twitch.tv/EnchantingCoyAppleRickroll-PepTOll-wEW9yFU8
krool_gamer: nuts and bolts was not enjoyed BECAUSE it was banjo but not the banjo everyone wanted. if it hadn't been banjo, it'd probably had been received better
someguy_matt: dude the mission structure lets you build literally anything you want to beat it
ThirdWall: Photosensitivity warning on that clip
ThirdWall: Like big time
someguy_matt: everyone talks about how much they love open mission structure but then ignore nuts n bolts

betterCallSalt_: Ty
history83: Hey Nik guess who was here
betterCallSalt_: History!!
mastertank56: it's a diablo like
history83: yep Tank
betterCallSalt_: Hey brother
mastertank56: pronounced last epic
history83: @betterCallSalt_ Yes!!!
loc0lob0: diablo ehhh?
betterCallSalt_: LUL
mastertank56: it's a good mix of both
a_n_i_v: sneaky wokenpL
mastertank56: more customization then diablo but less than PoE
SeeFooBoo: ok nik I have a question about the surge, is the augmented edition worth $2 cause the Surge is 2.99 on steam rn
mastertank56: they've been in beta for awhile and just released their multiplayer
betterCallSalt_: Can't golf tonight but that was tempting
mastertank56: they're exceptionally transparent about their development and also listen to the community a ton
SeeFooBoo: Nice sell. Up to you $2.99 is real cheap
mastertank56: i'm going for a build that I just kill everything with a swarm of squirrels
betterCallSalt_: You never know they are  the old days until they are gone
mastertank56: you get summon wolf but there's a unique that halves their damage but doubles the amount of summons and turns them into squirrels
betterCallSalt_: asaltrLurk  have a great stream!
mastertank56: and they do a shit ton of bleed and physical resist tear
mastertank56: the unique actually gives them even more health
mastertank56: it's really fucking good
history83: Hey Nik guess what game I played today?
history83: Iratus
mastertank56: and the buddy I'm running with wants to level up the same class once I get mine running so we can just have double the squirrels
history83: I am liking it so far have no clue what I am doing but hey who needs to know how to play a game right, right?
mastertank56: it'll be.....nuts Kappa
mastertank56: it's a post level 70 drop only so it's pretty end game
history83: yep

SeeFooBoo: you're watching replay aren't you
MR_CRASH87: Atleast the check point is near LUL
someguy_matt: no idea where the song is from
SeeFooBoo: I think you need to keep speed for the 3 shell bump
MR_CRASH87: Eating some chocolate chip cookies now and just relaxing for the night
SeeFooBoo: into the switch and down
someguy_matt: there's a new ffxv mobie game that was being advertised on tiktok like every shitty mobie game so i made a video ranting about it
SeeFooBoo: H
a_n_i_v: it's all good MingLee
someguy_matt: turns out its a reskin of some random mobile game from the 2010s
MR_CRASH87: Help yourself brother nikdudSmile
someguy_matt: which made me more upset
someguy_matt: H
someguy_matt: i'll send the ad
someguy_matt: cuz square cares about the brand
SeeFooBoo: yeah I just chilling watching your stream deciding if I have energy to get into a game
someguy_matt: like its dog shit
history83: I just saw that ad today Matt
someguy_matt: if that was the first ffxvi game people would be upset
MR_CRASH87: Yeah no nuts just regular chocolate chip
someguy_matt: but they don't care about xv
someguy_matt: you want me to send you the ad here or on discord
someguy_matt: would love to see your live reaction to ti as someone who enjoyed XV too
MR_CRASH87: I never had them before
SeeFooBoo: grab shell?
MR_CRASH87: This is very confusing
SeeFooBoo: you're getting it
someguy_matt: like i can't believe square enix licensed out a game and let them do the standard mobile game ad tactics
someguy_matt: gg?
MR_CRASH87: Wtf ahahahahaha
MR_CRASH87: I legit thought you passed it LUL LUL LUL
history83: I dont see what you need to do here
SeeFooBoo: can you drop the square block on the left?
someguy_matt: this is not what the game is like btw
SeeFooBoo: this doesn't help
someguy_matt: i get ads like this for zombie games all the time on tiktok
someguy_matt: imagine my surprise when Noctis and Luna are in it for some reason
SeeFooBoo: it may be misleading you may just need to go fast
SeeFooBoo: woah
history83: oh ok can you pick him up again?
SeeFooBoo: drop it ther
SeeFooBoo: drop it before he kicks i think for consistency
history83: so close
SeeFooBoo: the block
SeeFooBoo: drop the block before the second koopa kicks the shell
SeeFooBoo: drop the shell, run right, pickup the block, drop hit switch before the kick happens
savagehenre: heard great things about this hack
savagehenre: relaxing with some bud
SeeFooBoo: I mean do your thing, hopefully I'm not backseating too much
a_n_i_v: gg
savagehenre: oh im smoking it
SeeFooBoo: this is really cool
SeeFooBoo: It's meant to be ran fast
SeeFooBoo: doing this clean would probably feel really good

jellyfish_trifle: I've just finished Frankenstein and started "So you've been publicly shamed"
SayYestotheJes: omg Frankenstein was my fave book I ever had to read for school, and So You've Been Publicly Shamed is V INTERESTING!!!!
jellyfish_trifle: It's a non-fiction by Jon Ronson. It's basically about "cancel culture" before that was a thing.
Snoreslax: i think if the moving shell is going right the stationary will fall right and vice versa
jellyfish_trifle: Like how normal people's lives can be hugely impacted because they do something wwrong and the internet goes crazy over it
Snoreslax: so the past few times youve been hitting it on the bounce off the wall
Snoreslax: and the first time you had it right in the corner

SayYestotheJes: @Shaun_Da_Bomb shaund1ShaunPats shaund1ShaunPats shaund1ShaunPats shaund1ShaunPats shaund1ShaunPats
jellyfish_trifle: 5 deep? You flew too close to the sun, Shaun.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @jellyfish_trifle I figured I had to go for 5 since slowmode was on Kappa
EyeOdin: I just recieved Cd0h's  notice for her stream LUL
ratatremy: Doing good. Pretty tired tho
ratatremy: I had jury duty selection today LUL
EyeOdin: it was on discord there is something happening wrong there. I never get there in time
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ratatremy dang lucky! Lol Ive only ever had like the first step in that process
EyeOdin: not me
navysquirrel: i had jury duty last month
e_mcsqrd: I'm exempt!!
history83: I have not had to do jury duty yet thank goodness
SayYestotheJes: i got picked once but i was released because my brother is in prison LUL so i didn't have to do it
MR_CRASH87: i was selected but when i got there they sent me home
EyeOdin: in my country there is no jury duty I think
ratatremy: I made it to the next round. It‚Äôs like March Madness üòà
MR_CRASH87: they said i didnt have to stay there so i said thank you goodbye LUL
e_mcsqrd: While I'm academic, I also work in medical and i'm one of the listed exempt groups
SayYestotheJes: i'm rooting for you @ratatremy i have you winning my jury duty bracket
EyeOdin: doctors are importante for society?
EyeOdin: I guess
GiganticBucket: I got out of grand jury duty as a dev on a small team because our CFO & CTO wrote a letter requesting exemption LUL
e_mcsqrd: I think it takes us away from patients and stuff ?
e_mcsqrd: I wish i had a better answer...but I won't complain lol
history83: yea grand jury is like 5 days long even if you dont get selected
a_n_i_v: well it might mean all four answers get said in 5 seconds?
GiganticBucket: grand jury duty for us was like 2 days a week for 3 months, no matter what
e_mcsqrd: you can have a bench warrant out for you. i think it's an offense
ratatremy: You just get called back like three months later LUL
MR_CRASH87: i think you go to jail or get fined if you dont go
SayYestotheJes: yeah you can be in contempt of court if you don't show
yoshi_lover_: Ready to be blown
GiganticBucket: They don't have that power, but the judge/prosecutor agreed to it (but looked disappointed in me LUL )
e_mcsqrd: if you fail to attend court when you're requested to do so
jellyfish_trifle: @GiganticBucket That'd be a cool setting for a movie or book. A bunch of strangers continuing to go about their lives but thrown together twice per week for months. Then they go their separate ways forever.
MR_CRASH87: don't quote me on that LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
SSVick: So if my name was Toad_lover_ would you put the shower cap?
yoshi_lover_: Duuuuuude.  Dooooooope.
Snoreslax: it depends on your county here in the states, ive definitely dodged jury duty twice
Snoreslax: and no warrant luckily
SSVick: LUL
EyeOdin: I mean you can recieve mail BUT if you dont have mail how can you recieve it even?
MetalCrazy666: I did not hear it
Snoreslax: i show up and sign out on a smoker sheet
SayYestotheJes: my hope is that i am now on a blacklist for jury duty tbh LUL
Snoreslax: they never call and i never come back
jellyfish_trifle: !plant
GiganticBucket: @jellyfish_trifle Until mysterious circumstances 10 years later reunite them one last time...
yoshi_lover_: Mainly just watch.  Played Learn2Kaizo about 5 years ago.  Got stuck on the double shell jump and decided to take a break.  Still on break.
MetalCrazy666: NODDERS
MR_CRASH87: !plant
history83: !plant
MR_CRASH87: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
history83: that is horse shit
Snoreslax: lol idk but i have had no repercussions
jellyfish_trifle: @GiganticBucket Only this time they have to solve the crime themselves
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @yoshi_lover_ If I can do it u definitely can!
history83: @yoshi_lover_ that isnt saying much
SayYestotheJes: it's the cooldown + slow mode combo tbh
history83: !plant
MR_CRASH87: !plant
history83: sorry Crash
yoshi_lover_: Call of duty from time to time.  I also replay the dkc series at least once a year.  Don't game too often.  Oh and playing hogwarts currently.  Awesome game so far.

eejay: nikdudSmug
Snoreslax: level 2 i think

SuperCaptainRob: Aniv is truly the greatest thinker of our time
MR_CRASH87: I currently use my sisters HBO MAX account
betterCallSalt_: oh yo, we can be the micro weenie warriors
history83: oh dang I missed it ok
Ginger_Tech_: Wait, Aniv subs to you? Damn. LUL
baddiebec: Is Aniv losing his mind here..?
betterCallSalt_: @baddiebec never had one
jellyfish_trifle: I like to think aniv is working on some serious problems and just has stream on in the background. Then he jumps in from time to time to get our help on points.
ShadowPandaaaa: did you say age of empires?
MinisterGold: like its easy to know what you did wrong i guess?
SuperCaptainRob: Learning to play an RTS competitively is brutal
MinisterGold: oh man
MinisterGold: yea when you fuck up in Smash, you find out in a few seconds... haha
SuperCaptainRob: In college I tried to work my way up the ladder in Starcraft 2.  I never made it past the bottom of Silver
betterCallSalt_: StinkyCheese
SuperCaptainRob: Professional Star Craft is really fun to watch though.  The players are insane
betterCallSalt_: grinding kaizo > grinding RTS -Nik
MinisterGold: so are you giving up on playing AOE competitively then
MinisterGold: well... i get the feeling you like halo a lot and are good at it
SuperCaptainRob: Part of what I found frustrating with RTS multiplayer is that I really like slowly building up resources in singleplayer but that playstyle is not possible in multiplayer.  You're gonna get crushed by an aggro strat every time
jellyfish_trifle: Did you hit diamond in a previous season of Halo?
MinisterGold: that's fair
MR_CRASH87: I‚Äôm into halo
MinisterGold: and your friends only want to play it competitively?
MR_CRASH87: No LUL
SuperCaptainRob: There is a difference but it can be stubtle.  I'd say an aggro strat is able to keep going if the initial assault gets repelled, whereas a cheese strat is going to be a low skill all in which fails if the initial attack fails
MinisterGold: Hmm...do you have time to just split between the two or is that too much to grind
anotherMrEllis: its not cheese if it works
MinisterGold: so what if you were okay at being mediocre or growing slower in AOE
anotherMrEllis: just pick the spartan army in AOE, then its like you're playing both games anothe40Shrug
MinisterGold: okay with*
MinisterGold: yup i agree with that
MinisterGold: yea for sure
anotherMrEllis: just play whats fun none of us are hitting the top of the ladder anyway :P
MinisterGold: haha
betterCallSalt_: I used to think that Ellis, until I worked with someone who was literal top of ladder in a game. like, just outside of professional. nothing made me feel worse about my skills LUL
MR_CRASH87: That‚Äôs why I said this levels blows man LUL
betterCallSalt_: rocket league
SuperCaptainRob: I used to try and climb ladder in competitive (Hearthstone, Overwatch, League), but eventually I realized that I was making myself miserable.  There are people who like that grind, for me I get hooked on that grind, but I don't have fun.
MR_CRASH87: Bro I‚Äôm having the time of my life cause of you dude üíØüòé
betterCallSalt_: this level sucks and it ain't your fault, nik
betterCallSalt_: overwatch 2 makes me feel like a viewer sometimes
TheMFFlash: I bet salt is a dps moira
