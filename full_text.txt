SuperCaptainRob: lol hey Nik!
Metallichepe: !so SuperCaptainRob
ShikisKhakis: NIK NOOOO DON'T TRY IT LUL
a_n_i_v: Welcome in @tetsuoooo it was ok
SuperCaptainRob: I was offering to eat that for $696 but if you want to eat it for free go for it!
tm00n: Welcome in raidgers nikdudSmile
Metallichepe: welcome raiders
SuperCaptainRob: Thank you!
ShikisKhakis: also YOOOO NIIIIIIIIKKKKKKK!!!
SuperCaptainRob: We were having a debate about whether eating a whole tub of playdough would be worse on its own or mixed into a Subway Meatball Marinar
yawnegg: you can try a subdog 🌭 instead it's just as ass :)
ShikisKhakis: Nik's hats GOATED superc101PatPray
e_mcsqrd: I've been goin on the gym consistently from when i started university until now which has been about 20 years (ugh!!)
SuperCaptainRob: And stream was fantastic!  Hope yours has been great so far!
SerThiccems: shaund1FrogDance
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, the little cup
SerThiccems: HypeLUL
SerThiccems: I loved it
yawnegg: 5 dolla
TheMagicEel: a coke and a smile
SuperCaptainRob: Yep, playing Kingdom Hearts!  It's been fun.  I didn't think I'd like it going in but I've really enjoyed streaming it!
SerThiccems: Time to play KH
e_mcsqrd: any amount of money and then i'd donate it
history83: Playdough is too salty
yawnegg: lmaooo
SerThiccems: I mean KH do be enjoyable
e_mcsqrd: 100%.
history83: I might have when I was a kid
SuperCaptainRob: It just didn't seem like my type of game and I'm not really a big Disney person so the nostalgia factor wasn't a big appeal for me.
Metallichepe: i mean come on neek we were all kids
history83: look I never said I was a smart kid either
MR_CRASH87: playdough is very salty
SuperCaptainRob: lmao no they were not saying they would eat the playdough
ShikisKhakis: yeah if anything we were trying to talk rob out of eating it LUL
SuperCaptainRob: I've seen a lot of them.  The only Disney thing I REALLY love is Gravity Falls
a_n_i_v: teeeeeeebz
history83: glue
MR_CRASH87: a worm
TheMagicEel: here's a plan: host a casual party and put out soda and drinks but for food, deadass make the fake food things from playdough and just chomp in and start eating one
yawnegg: no no you don't understand 😃 so if you mix the playdough in with another food it magically is fine to eat :)
ShikisKhakis: yawn LUL
SuperCaptainRob: Yep, Gravity Falls is Disney
TheMagicEel: playdough weenies with toothpicks in them, etc
TheMagicEel: have someone chomp in and eat, see if the others do it
TheMagicEel: peer pressure test LUL
yawnegg: LUL
history83: !ashamed
kojacktrick: !vomit
SuperCaptainRob: That was the big debate, was would it help if you added the playdough into a Meatball Sub.  I contended that spreading the cup throughout a sub would make it more tolerable, chat thought otherwise
e_mcsqrd: I'm curious as to what you ate as a kid lol
history83: so what did you eat as a Kid I am dying to know
TheMagicEel: LUL
ShikisKhakis: YESSSS NIK
kojacktrick: Haha thanks so much Nik! kojack6Huehue kojack6Jam
e_mcsqrd: @history83 great minds!
history83: @e_mcsqrd yep
MR_CRASH87: playdough in spagetti
TheMagicEel: you were one of those kids!
yawnegg: true 🤔
SuperCaptainRob: Tasty chair sponge superc101PatChefsKiss
e_mcsqrd: hahahahaha was it tasty sponge?
history83: WTF !vomit
TheMagicEel: looks tasty mang
TheMagicEel: nom nom
Metallichepe: !home
e_mcsqrd: i had to lick a soap bar when I was a young kid because I kept swearing lol
history83: @e_mcsqrd same
MR_CRASH87: tasty sponge so the grool from goosebumps
e_mcsqrd: oh...i remember.  it was gross
TheMagicEel: LUL i had a lady who made me wash my mouth out with soap as daycare, i did it and then said 'it's not that bad, bitch' LUL
TheMagicEel: memory unlocked thanks for reminding me @e_mcsqrd
history83: OMG Eel really
MR_CRASH87: yeah i came from beneath the sink episode lmao
TheMagicEel: she was ANCIENT
SuperCaptainRob: I may play some more KH down the line, but for now I'm just beating one.  I already want to beat all the Mainline Mario games, all the Donkey Kong Games, and all the Devil May Cry games.  I don't need to add KH on top of that ha ha
TheMagicEel: she was like 75 at least and i was 9 or so
history83: TBH I would be ok with it as long as my kid deserved it
e_mcsqrd: I also wasn't smart enough to know that if my parents couldnt see me, it didn't mean they couldn't hear me.  so when they left the room, I would walk up and down the stairs and say the F-word over and over again ...I was probably 5. I learned it from my sister.
TheMagicEel: hahahahaha
TheMagicEel: kids LOVE doing stuff they know they shouldn't
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, playing Mario Sunshine last year really ignited my love for Mario and there's some big ones i haven't played
SuperCaptainRob: Oooh, which franchises sound like fun to play through?
TheMagicEel: turn into a yakuza streamer
SerThiccems: oooo yakuza do be fun
SuperCaptainRob: Metroid would be cool and pretty doable
e_mcsqrd: oh they confronted me and said if i did it again, i'd have to lick the soap.  I didn't listen. lol
TheMagicEel: you'd be a GOAT metroid streamer
SuperCaptainRob: Yep!  I'm also really excited for Odyssey!  I've been saving it but I'm hyped
a_n_i_v: Are you wearing gloves for practicr?
SuperCaptainRob: That would be next level!

So trying to make it so people can make an account and build their own gameslists for weighted voting
MinisterGold: tanks dude
MinisterGold: So back when I was accepting votes, they'd use channel points, and i would just enter it in manually. I don't think the app is particularly useful. Just using it as an excuse to practice my react and node
CptLongDongSilver: I am good, hands are full. 2 kiddos in my lap.

shakadactyl: Shaving facial hair DansGame Waxing facial hair SeemsGood
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Nik tell me not to order a Analogue Pocket
SayYestotheJes: @CptLongDongSilver listen. i grew up with 2 brothers and 2 other boys who lived with us growing up. i've trained myself to lift the seat when i'm done peeing so i don't have to worry about pee drips. LUL it's all gross.

shakadactyl: @SayYestotheJes Well, for me, waxing my lower legs hurt WAAAAY more than my upper. Waxing my pits doesn't hurt much at all.
shakadactyl: Waxing brows sounds super painful tho
YourGuy_Tyler: I have ~300 projects to check in on FeelsBadMan
YourGuy_Tyler: @SayYestotheJes FeelsBirthdayMan
shakadactyl: I've heard good things about epilation, but I would rather step on a LEGO
baddiebec: forget waxing and shavingg. Get Laser Hair removal annabelLit
shakadactyl: @baddiebec I WISH
YourGuy_Tyler: I'm a project analyst/manager.. I coordinate ~600-700 projects with a ground of 12 engineers but I manage only 10-30 projects where I charge my time.
shakadactyl: Maybe when it becomes more affordable @baddiebec
SayYestotheJes: that sounds like it just rips your hairs out lmfao YOIKES
shakadactyl: Yes! It is a torture device and people unironically vouch for it.
baddiebec: @shakadactyl totally understand! if you can do it. I've been doing it for a few weeks and it's soooo nice
DaGummi: it can leave scars and open pores in the skin afterwards right?
history83: So close Nik but yet so far
shakadactyl: @baddiebec How long do you have to wait inbetween sessions? And how many will you need?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: would u get the dock for it nik...
YourGuy_Tyler: yah, I just tell them where to go & am a back up option for communication

shakadactyl: @baddiebec Oh my gosh. Please tell me how it turns out. The idea of never having to shave, wax, or Nair again sounds like heaven Kreygasm
YourGuy_Tyler: you guys are RICHHHHH, streamer money Kappa
baddiebec: @shakadactyl lol yes! I'll keep you updated nikdudLove
Shaun_Da_Bomb: yup also we still have to wait until group C 2023 whatever that means

SayYestotheJes: i'd pay 200 for it to even remove my leg hair for a year LUL
shakadactyl: @SayYestotheJes If my hair was thin, I wouldn't care, but...
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @YourGuy_Tyler Na I just spend my money on dumb shit

Shaun_Da_Bomb: Its more like do I really NEED it
Shaun_Da_Bomb: lol
shakadactyl: $400 doesn't sound too bad considering how much we spend on hair removal products.
shakadactyl: And if it's permanent...
baddiebec: right @shakadactyl !!  and I make it like cool. got a face mask on. some wine errorbHipe
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I didnt realize hair removal is that much
anotherMrEllis: listen, I've seen where the stockmarket is at, putting money into hair removal is not the worst investment right now
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Okay so this is the main thing

SayYestotheJes: @baddiebec soooo laser hair removal party girls night on discord WHEN????

YourGuy_Tyler: @shakadactyl laser hair removal is something you do have to maintain every 6-12 months but it's easier to do that
shakadactyl: @SayYestotheJes That would be hilarious/awesome
SayYestotheJes: @Shaun_Da_Bomb dude it can cost like $20+ for a brow wax
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I could sell a lot of my other handhelds to easily pay for the pocket and it would be a better experience

SuperCaptainRob: I actually do find the controls in Galaxy a little disappointing.  They're not awful, but the last 3D Mario I played was Sunshine.  That one is so tight and has a lot of variety.  Galaxy doesn't have the dive at all and the backflip is /really/ finicky compared to other 3D Marios I've played

SayYestotheJes: Nickel Ore, one of the raw materials in Subnautica, can usually be found in the Lost River, but it can also be located in the Inactive Lava Zone. When venturing into the Lost River biome there are a few areas that you should look at, including: Bone Fields. Tree Cove. Ghost Canyon.
someguy_matt: only if its off camera
someguy_matt: only because there was a reflection
SayYestotheJes: and it says kyanite is Inactive Lava Zone/Lava Lakes/Lava Castle
Ginger_Tech_: Yo! How goes the Subnatica!

Ginger_Tech_: I was about to end anyway, but...
MrCope: !needsit
Ginger_Tech_: Yeah, there was no reason to get going since I was going to end in the next few mins.
Ginger_Tech_: But I gotta figure out why that happens. OBS sees the audio, but twitch doesn't receive it for some reason.
Ginger_Tech_: It was! And it went well. We've made some good progress otherwise.
Ginger_Tech_: So, I do have it setup as certain tracks and that is possibility because supposedly those who use specific tracks this happens to as well.
Ginger_Tech_: Yes, all white mages.

MR_CRASH87: yeah so chill it'll make me fall asleep smacke5LoveGIF

MetalCrazy666: I'm 66hours into yakuza 6 and I still have a lot of shit to do KEKW
SayYestotheJes: i still jump scare, but not as easily LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @SerThiccems nikdudFine
someguy_matt: just remember that you're not getting scared because something is scary, you're getting scared because someone blasted an air horn in your ear

raincoated: no its not
raincoated: rainco2Smug

SayYestotheJes: not a horror girlie for realsies. i can read horror much better than i can consume it in other ways (games, movies)
SayYestotheJes: Blair Witch made me RAGE. They made ALL THE WRONG CHOICES for being in the woods!!!!!!!!!!!
MR_CRASH87: the kothoga is very creepy man. that thing is crazy
SayYestotheJes: the first one made me so mad I won't watch another one

someguy_matt: whats up?
AndresTheUnicorn: We love Lightaligns here, and yeah, I only bought the game since I saw him play it loveso5Bongofrog
someguy_matt: i think i would end it with what i said in our chat earlier
someguy_matt: we started hanging out again and we're having a blast chilling
BennyKaPow: how's the castle treating you? which rooms have you gotten?
someguy_matt: but then halo went to the hospital
BennyKaPow: LightAligns? honest89GasmIntensifies kehzChefsKiss
BennyKaPow: also #teamhalo3
BennyKaPow: ghosts room is fun
someguy_matt: now it seems like he's on life support but his dad is pretending everything is fine
BennyKaPow: was ice/swim room in section 2?
BennyKaPow: that room is super hard. only beat it 2 or 3 times in runs
someguy_matt: am i wrong about that being the current state of halo tho
someguy_matt: i think it just needs more game classic halo game modes and maps
ErrorBorn: A battle royale mode could bring in some newbs ... I do love stomping noobs
someguy_matt: people only stopped cuz there was 3 game modes at launch and you coulnd't pick slayer
jellyfish_trifle: A think a BR is the only way for it to become mainstream again. The shift to F2P could have done that if they game had released in a better state.
someguy_matt: and like no maps
BennyKaPow: team slayer and team swat bennyk5HardYes honest89GasmIntensifies
ErrorBorn: Yeah we're too good clearly
someguy_matt: i don't think BR was needed
someguy_matt: cuz everyone was playing at launch
someguy_matt: it was just ruined by a lack of stuff
ErrorBorn: I try not to get salty about most things
ErrorBorn: Halo? They were close to 200K at launch
a_n_i_v: Batman
ErrorBorn: Now they're floating around like 7K? ... i think
e_mcsqrd: I'm a very salty and trash-talking competitive game player. as a result, i only play single player games lol
someguy_matt: @ErrorBorn that's just steam tho right
princesstrunks996: heyo all
someguy_matt: cuz you gotta factor in xbox pc and xbox console
MR_CRASH87: @princesstrunks996 hello there classi50Love

jellyfish_trifle: Hey princess T!
princesstrunks996: @mr_crash87 @nikduden7 @jellyfish_trifle hope ur well 😋❣️
ErrorBorn: Fortnite had 1.6M active players in the last hour
someguy_matt: @jellyfish_trifle cuz the support has been ass
someguy_matt: i don't think you can compare any game to fork knife tho
jellyfish_trifle: Yeah, I think it had a real shot. I convinced lots of friends to try it, including PS guys who'd never played Halo before. But they all gave up and moved on
ErrorBorn: Sure ... but they didn't market Halo. Like I didn't even know it launched until a month after it was out ...
someguy_matt: it's like comparing a movies box office to avengers
diamondback_zero_one: Im doing Two's Complement calculations manually. please kill me

someguy_matt: i would love to go back to school just to get a doctorate in film just so people have to call me Dr. Someguy
SayYestotheJes: also, you know, i'd love to support my community more. working in child welfare makes you wanna do more and do better. or at least, it does for me.

SuperCaptainRob: Doing great!  And yourself?
SuperCaptainRob: Stream was fantastic!
SuperCaptainRob: lol you're good.  I played Pepsiman and I tried 12 different combinations of soda and milk and made a tier list
SuperCaptainRob: Yeah, it's an event I've been planning for a while.  Just got soda on Amazon Fresh and Instacart ha ha
SuperCaptainRob: Definitely some interesting flavors, yeah.  Some really good, some not so much.  Shockingly none of them were really bad though.
SuperCaptainRob: Ha ha yeah, drinking a bunch of an awful one would've been a time
baddiebec: oh god yeah the NYE beer 🤮
someguy_matt: i had a bit of beer yesterday and it was poopoo
someguy_matt: it was the house beer for the place i went to with my buddies for my birthday
someguy_matt: but i also hate beer so not the best judge
SuperCaptainRob: Every now and again I pick up seaweed snacks hoping I'll like them this time since they're healthy.  But they always end up tasting really gross to me
history83: all beer is an acquired taste
SuperCaptainRob: They're like paper at first, but then they turn to a kind of gross mush.  The big issue though is that they really do taste like ocean water
someguy_matt: i think acquired taste is adult for bad but society does it so i have to too
baddiebec: cannot stand ittt
SuperCaptainRob: I really hate any kind of chewy meats, it's super offputting to me
raincoated: this is why i dont like bananas. the texture with that taste goes badge together
HometownTeam: The worst texture is coconut or oatmeal - anything mealy is yuck 🤢
MetalCrazy666: I drink beer cause I like
MetalCrazy666: the buzz Kappa
SuperCaptainRob: I think with acquired tastes they often have something on the front which is strong and can be offputting.  But when you try them more you get past that taste on the front and start to notice the more subtler tastes playing around it and enjoying those
raincoated: I heard if youre allergic to latex then youre likely allergic to bananas. i think
FDotFDot: I personally don’t like anything with a grainy texture
HometownTeam: Like wet, flaky, mushy with flakes - it’s giving me a tummy ache just thinking about it
FDotFDot: Uhh
history83: yea that is cool
raincoated: SUSHIIII
someguy_matt: yes
baddiebec: let's gooooooo
history83: you all can have your sushi I am good

HometownTeam: Same @history83
baddiebec: nvm I'm not coming lepMONK
someguy_matt: bring it
history83: yes we need to bring Dudge
SuperCaptainRob: I've never really been a sushi person.  I think my experiences with it when I was young weren't good (probably cause I grew up in Oklahoma and there wasn't a lot of good sushi there) and I just never went back to it
history83: I mean yea I will come and hang out
raincoated: HAHAHAHAH
baddiebec: ....I want sushi tbh....
MR_CRASH87: I love crab 🦀
HometownTeam: You would have to  chase me around the block with some sushi
SuperCaptainRob: I'm 100% down for fried rice
a_n_i_v: thats wine?!?!?!
baddiebec: @a_n_i_v yeah it's good. wine is good
history83: I have tried crab many times and I still dont like it
raincoated: our lordge and savior, raincoatedge
raincoated: ooh mussels
someguy_matt: they have sushi at the ACC snd it was surprisingly not bad
raincoated: ^ that might have that grainy texture that Dot doesnt like
baddiebec: cheese wontons, beef short ribs, fried rice, ramen..
baddiebec: wait.. am I hungry
history83: I dislike all fish and seafood never had a taste for it
baddiebec: @someguy_matt no way!! I didn't know thisss
someguy_matt: i love sushi
FDotFDot: I had some macaroni goulash and my sister added some kd cheese shaker stuff, it was kinda grainy/gritty don’t really have any other examples other than that LUL
someguy_matt: but would you think hockey game sushi is good?
FDotFDot: LUL yeah I’ve eaten something like that before

Ginger_Tech_: Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.  Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could’ve stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me — we should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ginger_Tech_: @Shaun_Da_Bomb Yes. LUL
EyeOdin: can I make a small coding question?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @Ginger_Tech_ LUL setting the bar high
Ginger_Tech_: @Shaun_Da_Bomb Setting the bar low?
Snoreslax: its not as good as 3 houses imo but im hoping i may change my mind
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Thats the sense I get from Matt too
Shaun_Da_Bomb: But that might be also because his soul has left his body from trying to play chain of memories
EyeOdin: like for FOR loops. if I make iterate on smaller lists does it go faster?
princesstrunks996: heyo all
FDotFDot: LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yo good evening @princesstrunks996
KatMakes: It doesn't go faster, it finishes faste.r
princesstrunks996: @Shaun_Da_Bomb hope ur well <3
Ginger_Tech_: They made Chain of Memories when Japan was going through a card game phase so that attributes to it a little bit.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @princesstrunks996 doing very well!
princesstrunks996: im good ty <3 hope ur well @NikDudeN7
EyeOdin: that would help still
EyeOdin: I am doing a process and sometimes it takes 30minutes
Ginger_Tech_: Yeah, very close together actually.
EyeOdin: I am worrying with performance now
EyeOdin: I am on Python. I am working on a open source plugin for a program called Krita
EyeOdin: the problem is Image packing
Ginger_Tech_: Python is actually super easy.
EyeOdin: Krita is a painting software
EyeOdin: a dot org program
Ginger_Tech_: I do.
EyeOdin: image packing is organizing images to make the set occupy the less space possible
Ginger_Tech_: Nothing terribly advanced, but I had a few classes and did some Minecraft modding with it.
EyeOdin: visual compression I guess. it usefull in the real world to ship stuff
Ginger_Tech_: Anyway, Headed out, gotta get some rest.
Ginger_Tech_: Ya'll have a good night@
EyeOdin: I made my own flavour to organize stuff
raincoated: NIGHT JINJO

FDotFDot: Its quite different
FDotFDot: i like worlds more tho
FDotFDot: more reliant on wirebug
FDotFDot: in rise
EyeOdin: I heard the litigation's against copyright infringement on AI for art has started
B2De81: yeah, who knows how they and or the people around em drive
SerThiccems: Worlds has more detail in it than rise
SerThiccems: and the food just looks better
FDotFDot: LUL
LightAligns: worlds is my favorite MH I've played
FDotFDot: not wrong and the food makes it 2x better imo LUL
StreaminLeeman: I named my character Ralph, my dog is "Also Ralph" and my cat is "Not Ralph" KEKW
SerThiccems: I was so excited to see the food in rise and was very sad about it
FDotFDot: cd0hMonkaW
SerThiccems: get it delivered
B2De81: pay the ones who serve
SerThiccems: They could have called out
LightAligns: artist names and examples shouldn't be added into the pool for learning art I believe
a_n_i_v: perfect 2 super ridley incoming
raincoated: delivered rainco2Smug sry im hungry
EyeOdin: legally now you can't own the Intellectual property of AI art. but problem is the trainning which is basically breaks copyright
FDotFDot: LUL
EyeOdin: and on a massive scale
EyeOdin: sure
StreaminLeeman: brioDetective
FDotFDot: cd0hMonkaW
FDotFDot: somegu34Bet
B2De81: copywriting laws are so jacked
EyeOdin: yes they are
LightAligns: @a_n_i_v fast fast phantoon incoming
FDotFDot: somegu34Nu...
e_mcsqrd: wow!
EyeOdin: looks good
StreaminLeeman: Oh shit PogBones
FDotFDot: now look at his fingers Kappa
EyeOdin: I am surprised they didnt faster and i still think the worse is still to come for AI
LightAligns: yeah, ask for his hands
FDotFDot: LUL
B2De81: hahaha
EyeOdin: I have seen 8 finger hands
TheMFFlash: That artwork is sick
LightAligns: ai prompt.   hands upon hands upon hands
B2De81: hands are just as jacked as copywrite laws
FDotFDot: LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Microsoft Paint
FDotFDot: yeye mspaint
FDotFDot: somegu34Dance
FDotFDot: I agree
EyeOdin: no AI here. I want to acctually learn how to illustrate. I make plugins to help me with it
LightAligns: I haven't used any personally
LightAligns: I have problems with ai art being used commercially personally
B2De81: ai is gonna mess up sampling laws even worse
LightAligns: but I'm not going to shove it down peoples throats
B2De81: musically
a_n_i_v: jaycBeer jaycPet jaycBeer
EyeOdin: human artists will be unemployed completley
B2De81: we'll have it soon, I'm sure
LightAligns: yeah, pretty much.
B2De81: the future is spooky
LightAligns: but also that you can prompt with artists names and it will emulate their style because it has been trained with their artwork
B2De81: as I shake my cane
BennyKaPow: I think AI art is just another tool to be used
EyeOdin: because Artstation was flooded with anti AI protests. Artstation is like where professionals show their portefolio and there are new AI artists literally shitting on others
LightAligns: there's a YouTube channel called dadabots that is ai music being trained on certain bands one month at a time
BennyKaPow: peeps were freaked about Photoshop and said it'd ruin art but here we are
FDotFDot: ehhhn
EyeOdin: Photoshop is a tool AI is literally a commision
cd0h: ^^^^
EyeOdin: there was a guy "employ me I am an AI artist and I can replace 20 of your artists"
EyeOdin: how can you be crappy when it is generating from Good Artists?
EyeOdin: LUL
BennyKaPow: ^ this mentality is because people are stupid not because AI art is bad
B2De81: $
raincoated: ai art IS bad
cd0h: if the painting has 6 fingers it's ai art LMAO
BennyKaPow: idk, imo it's like saying it's not music if it's auto tuned or uses synthesizers
FDotFDot: @cd0h LUL

Otakaru: Kreygasm100 Just sux that we were so close to Apple using Gecko Firefox rendering engine But they chose KHTML instead as the base for their rendering engine that eventually turned into WebKit When Google first launched Chrome they used WebKit but eventually developed Blink rendering engine for Chromium based browsers ex. Chrome Edge Brave Vivaldi etc We were so close to not having to deal with fragmentation in the way browsers render but they ended up going their separate ways At least IE is ded

LightAligns: synesthesia?
e_mcsqrd: it's 100% real.  mostly words have tastes...called lexical-gustatory synesthesia
history83: @jellyfish_trifle yes he is
e_mcsqrd: sometimes it's good lol. sometimes it's not (depends on the taste).  It's a pretty rare form of it.
LightAligns: I have a minor version of  something that's similar to synesthesia, but I know some other people with other forms

baddiebec: lepMONK
baddiebec: LUL
baddiebec: never heard of it
tm00n: I read a book about it in middle school I think
LightAligns: I had a friend who saw colors when music played.   another who saw every letter of the alphabet as a different color
e_mcsqrd: oh! @LightAligns your friend probably has perfect pitch???
LightAligns: he did actually.   and played violin.  i assume that's a comorbidity because of the visual cue
tm00n: It was called A Mango Shaped space. It made me cry
history83: I didnt notice it until you pointed it out. Now I cant unsee it shaking
e_mcsqrd: ya!  they researched me one of the universities.  I told them that I wish i had a useful form of synesthesia that would give me something like perfect pitch.
LightAligns: it means having one symptom or syndrome usually comes with another one.
history83: no it is all good
someguy_matt: so if someone says a word wrong does it taste like someone cooked something incorrectly?
tm00n: Quit and play sub naughty ca nikdudSmile
someguy_matt: Nik not finishing a game? never
baddiebec: yeah like when Nik says Cilantro I feel like Imma have food poisoning @someguy_matt

a_n_i_v: no chainsaw beam in fusion?
parttimedogfish: I've got 90 minutes at work before I'm done for a week so pretty good!
betterCallSalt_: that's what she said?
history83: Here is what reddit said for the Ghost Leviathans.  If you're in a cyclops, just ahead-slow+silent running around the edges of where they're swimming. If they do attack, don't panic and use your defenses, and if all else fails, play dead->repair->start engines->decide on your exit strategy. The cyclops is sturdy and can take quite a bit of punishment.
JiyangSong: ohhhh hey, home base...named...uh...Bob
JiyangSong: Bob is a great name
JiyangSong: Base Bob
history83: @JiyangSong or just hear me out Bob Base

StreaminLeeman: I switched from the lance to the twin blades and don't hate the combat now LUL
betterCallSalt_: @StreaminLeeman that's probably good since isn't the point of the game to do combat? LUL
parttimedogfish: I like hiking and cycling, and it is very compatible with those
StreaminLeeman: Salt LUL
StreaminLeeman: I think I like the faster weapons because I can dodge roll a lot better. I'm bad at blocking stuff so I'd rather roll
parttimedogfish: charge shit, and shit shouNotes
hockey_rocker10: Yes you do
StreaminLeeman: You just put up your shield, at least that's how it worked with the lance
hockey_rocker10: The reinforced suit I believe
parttimedogfish: if it doesn't beam straight to your base, yes
JiyangSong: oh no

hockey_rocker10: If you make the reinforced suit you should be fine
HometownTeam: Not yet but I’m ready when it does
hockey_rocker10: Gotcha mvpsilBopcat
hockey_rocker10: Yes it looks sick
a_n_i_v: pumping fissure once you hit 12 = druid can solo players 8 until nightmare.. I must be dreaming
Otakaru: Aniv the only D2 nik like's is Destiny 2
hockey_rocker10: It’s just like the Xboxs but better
StreaminLeeman: midnightge
Otakaru: the fact that its not an xbox controller means its better Kappa
hockey_rocker10: It’s just more customizable
LaGrandePeche: Don't ask I don't know what is in your locker
hockey_rocker10: With the adaptive triggers which I like them in subnautica below zero
StreaminLeeman: braryPog Heck yeah
Metallichepe: you made it , nice
Metallichepe: lee WOOBLY
StreaminLeeman: Metal! WOOBLY
Metallichepe: Good thing i didnt see the path to the lost river, so didnt got spoiled
LaGrandePeche: Man...I am still wounded from my last hardcore run. I uninstalled LUL
hockey_rocker10: Just makes it harder to push but it feels good

Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah Legend of Dragoon just my first ever JRPG
LaGrandePeche: I wish this game was multiplayer SOOO bad
MR_CRASH87: naw but i remember the ghost
hockey_rocker10: I think I should start a hardcore world in below zero 💪
JiyangSong: i want that knift
JiyangSong: *knife
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Oh yeah Im fully aware of Peches love for LoU2 haha
LaGrandePeche: I think the last of us 2 is a masterpiece. Aside from a couple parts.
JiyangSong: ohai Shaun
someguy_matt: am back
Shaun_Da_Bomb: BTW we are still doing a PS1 night in the near future
LaGrandePeche: @Shaun_Da_Bomb you should try and play it again.
a_n_i_v: @Shaun_Da_Bomb the person looking for ian
MR_CRASH87: LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @JiyangSong hey hey friendo!
hockey_rocker10: Yeah
someguy_matt: do you think its sequelitis with it?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I feel like LoU2 feels like Star Wars Ep. 8
JiyangSong: smifficJam
history83: !home
LaGrandePeche: The story telling and character development is amazing. In the LOU2
someguy_matt: the sequel doesn't feel as special because it wasn't your first time with the series so its less fresh
hockey_rocker10: Your definitely gonna need to have the reinforced suit to survive down in the lava zone
JiyangSong: yoooooo let's goooooooo
hockey_rocker10: Watch for that sea dragon too 😬
someguy_matt: what did land ever do to you
StreaminLeeman: yoshiSTEER
hockey_rocker10: Use the bike on land it’s fun
baddiebec: yooooo
LaGrandePeche: Yes I did....I was skeptical as well. Like I understand why some people don't like it. If you can get past some things and just look at the game without a bias stand point, it's s tier. imo of course PrideCute
baddiebec: looks warm nikdudLove
parttimedogfish: looks like Walter White's lab
parttimedogfish: full of blue crystals
raincoated: yes
history83: yes
hockey_rocker10: Yes
LaGrandePeche: YES!
someguy_matt: what if you don't like it?
hockey_rocker10: Oh that’s not good
LaGrandePeche: @parttimedogfish yo wuddup homie
baddiebec: do. not die....
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean I compare it to ep 8 because it subverts your expectations in a lot of ways so some people applaud it for it... but I just really disliked almost all the characters lol but Im glad Peche is loving it
LaGrandePeche: @baddiebec wuddup homie g
Metallichepe: so this is how you gather kyanite , fuck i need this suit
hockey_rocker10: Need mk3
JiyangSong: are we gonna die?
baddiebec: @lagrandepeche pechyboiii hope you're doing well nikdudLove
parttimedogfish: @lagrandepeche shouHaj yo! how was the rest of stream?
a_n_i_v: MTG is better than agreed
HometownTeam: Fearless lol
MR_CRASH87: i beat the last of us
MR_CRASH87: but i never played the 2nd game
someguy_matt: i dunno why you wouldn't
LaGrandePeche: I would just play it nik you might like it. You might not. It's DEF worth a play!
someguy_matt: but what if you're like "guys im not having fun"
Landalin: nikdudHand
MetalCrazy666: nikdudHand nikdudHand nikdudHand
StreaminLeeman: nikdudHand
LaGrandePeche: You can borrow my PS4 if you want LUL
LaGrandePeche: I have both on there
Shaun_Da_Bomb: U dont think episode 8 didnt try subverting expectations? With how Luke is, Snoke, Rays back story... etc
Landalin: whats up legendary gamer nikdgedudge7dge
hockey_rocker10: They take your power
parttimedogfish: lava larva sucking your juice
Metallichepe: oooffff
hockey_rocker10: Use the shield to get them off
JiyangSong: again, i must ask..................are we gonna die?
LaGrandePeche: I was half joking LUL
Metallichepe: shouSTEER
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
JiyangSong: lol
LaGrandePeche: episode 8 just seemed lazy and uninspired imo
someguy_matt: didn't Ryan Johnson write it?
someguy_matt: or did he just direct it?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Rian Johnson... the dude that made a handful of movies and disney thought it was a great idea to have him direct one of the biggest franchise movies ever lol
ErrorBorn: !home
someguy_matt: @Shaun_Da_Bomb that's how we got the best thor movie
Metallichepe: neek how much longer are you gonna keep on strimming
a_n_i_v: I’m working on imyt?
someguy_matt: Disney actually does that a lot
Shaun_Da_Bomb: The problem is 8 was more interesting than 7 but the whiplash between 7 to 8 and 8 to 9 just makes the trilogy unwatchable
someguy_matt: they'll pluck someone who's made some solid smaller movies then toss them a fat budget
LaGrandePeche: nah fuck that call in and drop some acid!
JiyangSong: I mean, do you feel like going to the office tomorrow would enrich your life?
JiyangSong: yep!
hockey_rocker10: I like how they put things from below zero in the original subnautica
Landalin: Adam Driver was a pretty established actor but yeah star wars made him more of a bigger star
someguy_matt: think about it Nik
someguy_matt: im streming tomorrow
StreaminLeeman: Snow sholziMadge
HometownTeam: And people - the office has people.
baddiebec: yeah WFH Neek, so we can be distracted and watch Matt
Landalin: yo you smash your bros at the office sometimes?
Landalin: gnarly
HometownTeam: Oh - I don’t like the people part of the office. WFH is where it’s at for me
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Interesting doesnt equal good lol I just mean 7 was definitely a much safer movie. It was essential Ep 4 lol
JiyangSong: harrison ford literally got the role because his friend was like "oh hey, we need someone to read these characters for other people to audition against" and he did such a good job with Han Solo and got the role without even formally auditioning for it.
JiyangSong: or so the legend says
LaGrandePeche: Hot take Star Wars is garbo
Landalin: i liked the part where princess leah decided to become a spaceship
LaGrandePeche: I work from homer
ErrorBorn: nikdudHand
JiyangSong: yes, indiana jones came out 4 years later
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @JiyangSong Harrison Ford had made the movie American Graffiti and worked with Lucas on it
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Harrison starred in it
JiyangSong: oh hey!
a_n_i_v: There it is smcharBanger
JiyangSong: i forgot about that
Landalin: I am looking for a work from home job rn
ErrorBorn: Yeah it's usually pretty empty in the office.
HometownTeam: I’ve been WFH since the start of the pandemic so April 2020 and I never want to work in the office every day ever again
ErrorBorn: There used to be like 70-80 people ... now it's like 12?
JiyangSong: i work from home.  i mean, i gotta go to the office once a week, but the rest of the week i'm home
JiyangSong: i love that knife, seriously
someguy_matt: the snow doesn't help
Shaun_Da_Bomb: American graffiti was I think Harrisons first big movie
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah its pretty good
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Not really an action movie
someguy_matt: guys i've been listening to the opening theme of KH2 so much since both Shaun and i are getting close to it
hockey_rocker10: Don’t know if you have the stuff for the reinforced suit but it’s blood oil in the blood kelp zone
someguy_matt: im so excited
HometownTeam: I’m less efficient at the office so I’m behind the day after
Landalin: KH2 poggies
JiyangSong: yee yee
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Its more of a film about kids hanging out in the 60s
Landalin: simple and clean more nostalgic for me
someguy_matt: i don't know if its a hot take but i think they get better with each game
JiyangSong: it's my...sanctuary, my sanctuary <3
hockey_rocker10: You need three of them
someguy_matt: Simple and Clean < Sanctuary < Don't Think Twice
MR_CRASH87: ghost organs
history83: BOOBA
JiyangSong: yeeyee, lyrics
HometownTeam: Your base is nice - you have a nice setup
Landalin: I definitely played way too many hours of KH2 grinding materials to max Soras attack stat for no real reason because game is easy anyway
Landalin: but i loved it
history83: yep
Landalin: did they add crouching to this game yet?
HometownTeam: Pinning stuff is from below zero - when did they put it here?
someguy_matt: you can grind out items that boost attaack
a_n_i_v: or is it just became friends will meet up with his videos were like "yeah it sucks
parttimedogfish: it's a shame they didn't add snapping to grid though
Landalin: you just farm material items from enemies and use the item synthesis
StreaminLeeman: Even when you say large I think you're doing a -ge word KEKW
Landalin: @a_n_i_v being friends with you and meeting up would suck
HometownTeam: Cool - I haven’t played this in a long time
hockey_rocker10: Finally have the battery life icons

MrCope: did you do Sauna Mario World? Slighty harder but really fun
MrCope: can't remember who made it
MrCope: sounds right
e_mcsqrd: pnaha
e_mcsqrd: ya!
jomyjomyy: those octopus sprites look pretty cool
e_mcsqrd: deep sea
jomyjomyy: deep sea
jomyjomyy: thalassophobia is real.
e_mcsqrd: i'll take on the demons.   if they exist, i have an army of guardian spirits that will kick their butts.
jomyjomyy: deep sea
e_mcsqrd: deep sea...you'd live longer.  at least in deep space you'd die immediately
baddiebec: brb
MrCope: I'd aim for the sun
e_mcsqrd: oh damn.... deep sea still i think
MrCope: YEEEETTTT
e_mcsqrd: what would you pick?
MrCope: well in the documentary film, Sunshine...I think it took 26 months
jomyjomyy: let's say you're in a barrel of boogers up to your neck and someone is going to puke on you. Do you duck?
e_mcsqrd: at least space would be pretty. ???
raincoated: SUNSHINE GOOD MOOVIEEEEE
MrCope: @raincoated yes it is
raincoated: lieforRave lieforRave lieforRave lieforRave
MrCope: kehzHmm is Sunshine on Prime for Watch Party
e_mcsqrd: that's a terrile question @jomyjomyy .... ugh....i would duck.
MrCope: it's not lsrSad
e_mcsqrd: i figure...stomach acid would burn my face.
jomyjomyy: i think the smell of puke would be horrible, and if you duck you'll just get it on the way up. i'd probably just faint.
MrCope: Open wide. Power move.
e_mcsqrd: but....if you go into the barrel....would you not puke and you'd have to deal with both??
jomyjomyy: sushi
e_mcsqrd: oh chicken wings!
raincoated: CHICKEN WINGs
MrCope: kehzHmm too vague
MrCope: lsrActually the sushi is the rice
e_mcsqrd: spicy is my fav! bring it on!
MrCope: sorry tabasco is so rough on you
e_mcsqrd: did you have a problem with tabasco?
jomyjomyy: Oh man, I bought a rotisserie chicken today and bathed it in tabasco.
MrCope: Steve-O? what year is it
jomyjomyy: I used to grow scorpion peppers. I'm good with things up to about 2 million scovilles.
e_mcsqrd: hahahaha.  hilarious.  I get it...kinda like when i grab the 1 lb weights for my buddy that I work out with
MrCope: Sriracha? what year is it
jomyjomyy: it was in the small seaside town of Si Racha, Thailand in 1949 that resident Ms. Thanom Chakkapak first created this magical sauce, and named it after the town she lived in
jomyjomyy: ^just googled sriracha origins.
e_mcsqrd: i'm not a fan.
jomyjomyy: I think it's hells good in ramen
MrCope: it might be too much spice for you
MrCope: I only cried because you stabbed me in the hand with a fork because I laughed when you couldn't handle the spice
jomyjomyy: I have a friend who finds ketchup hot.
MrCope: very petty
e_mcsqrd: oooooo wow! so entertaining
jomyjomyy: ya, he breaks out in sweat
The_AmongUs_Guy_: hey Nik, hru?
jomyjomyy: i don't get it. there's like no capsaicin in ketchup
e_mcsqrd: @MrCope you're missing a wide open lay-up with the ketchup comment.... "yes...his name is NikDudeN7"
a_n_i_v: @e_mcsqrd te cayo mermela
The_AmongUs_Guy_: im all right just dealing with after effects of food poisoning
jomyjomyy: LUL
jomyjomyy: sorry, not laughing at your food poisoning
The_AmongUs_Guy_: @jomyjomyy how dare you laugh at my food poisoning, lol
The_AmongUs_Guy_: but yeah i knew what u were laughing at
MrCope: the Legend of Deez
jomyjomyy: food poisoning sucks. wouldn't wish it on anyone.
The_AmongUs_Guy_: just something off in a pizza
MrCope: Sorry, the Legend of the Dragoon. Typo'd
e_mcsqrd: and how a pH of 1-2 in the stomach doesn't kill off some pathogens!!
MrCope: I said I WANTED to
jomyjomyy: thermoacidophiles were only the 2nd known organisms on earth.
MrCope: busy AF
jomyjomyy: things that can handle acid and heat
MrCope: @jomyjomyy so not Nik
e_mcsqrd: ?eye-rate
jomyjomyy: are those the winged aliens from Metroid?
jomyjomyy: Super Metroid i mean
SSVick: Nice shower cap Nik
SSVick: bit tired and bit hungry
jomyjomyy: original Metroid is a terrible game, but Super Metroid is worth a play
SSVick: I'll eat some cereal then sleep
MR_CRASH87: hey bro
jomyjomyy: i hate this style of level. L/R shifting messes with me
MR_CRASH87: i was sleep just woke up
SSVick: I want a vacation LUL
e_mcsqrd: it messed with me in invictus
jomyjomyy: I don't think I played that far into Invictus
MR_CRASH87: probably lol jk
MrCope: speaking of sleep. I'm gonna crash early
raincoated: what was the question
jomyjomyy: if i nap, I just get cranky
MrCope: meow
e_mcsqrd: in the past 10 years, i've had trouble sleeping twice. i'm out in 30 seconds or less.
raincoated: rainco2Smug rainco2Smug rainco2Smug rainco2Smug  depends
SSVick: this work is just for the summer but its 6 days a week so its a bit tiring
raincoated: what does it depend on? wish i knew bc it'd help
SSVick: how you doing Nik?
e_mcsqrd: i get it from my dad.  he's the same way
jomyjomyy: you got a waifu pillow?
jomyjomyy: vertical dino head
jomyjomyy: and more metroid aliens
jomyjomyy: it looks like a set of jaws smashing
jomyjomyy: i think the first one you pointed at is the eye. and the neck is a jet pack. because why no
jomyjomyy: not
jomyjomyy: couldn't tell ya. I'd probably think someone spiked my drink
jomyjomyy: nice
facebug: What’s poggy woggying my poggers?
facebug: Not yet I did dl it though
facebug: Last I played was linnea? It was good
someguy_matt: somegu34Hi
facebug: Just intermediate, light gimmicks, readable and fun
someguy_matt: doing good. was chilling with friends
someguy_matt: hows it going?
someguy_matt: just chilled
facebug: Yeah it’s new. Might be in waiting
a_n_i_v: nooooo he missed the snout of the playthrough
someguy_matt: what were you gusy playing last night. i got home at like 1:30 and was tired.
someguy_matt: what system do you want to play on/how old of a game are you willing to put with
facebug: Pls stop missing the snout
someguy_matt: lol i was going to say Awakening is the first one i played and is really solid
SSVick: first FE I playes was Awakening
someguy_matt: Engage has a bunch of throw backs so im not sure if you'll get as much out of it
someguy_matt: sadly its 3ds
SSVick: I would say so
someguy_matt: i'd say get a 3ds xl
someguy_matt: sorry
someguy_matt: new 3ds xl
facebug: I have the Mario maker 2ds
someguy_matt: the new 2ds xl is good but feels kinda cheap
SSVick: for switch you have Three Houses and Engage
facebug: That’s actually how I got my start in kaizo
someguy_matt: the new 3ds xl feels the best
someguy_matt: i'd say three houses then
SSVick: Warriors and Three Hopes are Musou style so keep away from them if you wanna start in FE LUL
SSVick: (in switch too)
someguy_matt: its prob the least fire emblme fire emblem
someguy_matt: but takes a lot of cues from persona
facebug: I used to have like all the castlevanias and ff  remakes and Mario kart aaand brain age
someguy_matt: like look up the opening cut scene for three houses
facebug: But no I watched stuff too like poo and ryu
someguy_matt: i was like oh shit when i first saw it
someguy_matt: just playing FE lol
someguy_matt: if the boys play something ill hop on discord
someguy_matt: nah i havent
someguy_matt: depends on the game
someguy_matt: its a tactics right
someguy_matt: advance wars like?
SSVick: strategy
someguy_matt: im surprised you haven't played FE Nik
someguy_matt: at least based off of how much you like FFT
raincoated: MATT
raincoated: macaro46Thicc macaro46Thicc macaro46Thicc
SSVick: eeveelPoint
someguy_matt: the only ones people played in NA before 3ds were GBA
someguy_matt: @raincoated RAIN
someguy_matt: somegu34Dance
someguy_matt: i like that tho
raincoated: lieforRave
TheUCanes: whut up
someguy_matt: feels good to beat a level on FE's hardest difficulty
someguy_matt: from awakening onward you can turn perma death on or off
TheUCanes: nah my life was consumed by czar
TheUCanes: i got a lot to catch up on
SSVick: FE Three houses and Engage you can go back X turns if you f it up
a_n_i_v: strykuCry
someguy_matt: its funny if you're playing on hard in three houses cuz you start out with 10 or something and a little before the mid point it goes up by a bunch
someguy_matt: and you're like oh im never going to use 15
someguy_matt: then shit get hard after the mid point
someguy_matt: and 15 very quickly becomes 3
someguy_matt: 10 rewinds
shakadactyl: What a cozy stream CoolStoryBob
someguy_matt: you have a limited number of rewinds
SSVick: to go back X turn
shakadactyl: How’s it going? SeemsGood I was supposed to schedule my tax appointment, but I, uh, didn’t, lol
SSVick: I think it goes up as you level your teacher level
someguy_matt: nah you can raise the number through some side stuff in three houses
someguy_matt: maddening is the hardest, i think you get less?
GiganticBucket: nikdudSmile Yo Nik, how ya doin?
n4rc01ep5y: n4rc01Party
someguy_matt: @SSVick do you know if you get less on maddening? i can't remember if you do
shakadactyl: It didn’t used to be hard. But I think over time our gov’t purposely made it more difficult. I had some tax crap from when I lived in Japan, so I had to get an accountant to deal with the headache
SSVick: I think you do
Landalin: got dang this is cozy
GiganticBucket: Fun hack IMO, how ya feeling about it?
shakadactyl: I envy Canadian tax season
SSVick: I remember having like 4 or something
Landalin: yoo what is this mario sprite i need lore
shakadactyl: I was an English teacher for two years
SSVick: I almost didnt use rewind for the last runs I did
someguy_matt: the rewinds feel like a lot before the mid point
Landalin: NOT THE CHILDREN
someguy_matt: then you start to panic
Landalin: i'm grinding pokemon violet now to try and get the greninja 7 star raid
Landalin: they do biweekly raids and thats the only chance you get to catch that pokemon
Landalin: and i was too noob to do the prior ones
shakadactyl: I speak enough to survive, but unfortunately, I live in an area where I get 0 use out of it. Would be surprised if I could hold a decent conversation anymore.
someguy_matt: @SSVick on maddening?
Landalin: nah no greninjas spawn in the world
GiganticBucket: Started watching Drink Masters, now making popcorn, then getting turbo cozy. nikdudLove
shakadactyl: Do it
SSVick: nice to see you, now I gotta go to sleep Bedge
Landalin: thats the point of the raids, to keep you invested and playing after you finish content
shakadactyl: Learn what they’re saying through osmosis
shakadactyl: Kanji is a PAIN. I feel ya
GiganticBucket: Competition show for high end bartending, lots of cool cocktail ideas.
Landalin: the best way to learn the language is to hear it and try and understand
Landalin: at least verbally
SSVick: @SSVick yeah last run I played was Golden Deer route in the hardest difficulty
shakadactyl: Application is important SeemsGood
GiganticBucket: Husband is really into it, I most enjoy tasting the results.
shakadactyl: I used DuoLingo for Italian
shakadactyl: Then got bored
Landalin: I know a good amount of spanish and i learn it mostly from practicing with native speakers rather than the 3 years i took in high school
someguy_matt: @SSVick nice. i've only beat maddening on deer. once on stream and once by myself
shakadactyl: Reading books in your target language is great!
someguy_matt: got two thirds into blue lions but it got very hard
GiganticBucket: Haven’t tried language learning as an adult. Doesn’t feel worth the investment since I don’t travel much…
shakadactyl: I wish I’d done it more when I was in my undergrad
shakadactyl: Manga is good too
someguy_matt: yeah there's three routes
Landalin: its not necessarily that they do a "bad job" but book learned spanish is very different from how its actually spoken, at least here in California where we have a lot of native Spanish speakers from mexico
shakadactyl: I forget all my Spanish from grade school LUL
SSVick: 4 routes + dlc
a_n_i_v: he was binge watch loard of that one
someguy_matt: lol yeah
e_mcsqrd: never too late! play piano!
Landalin: Get a saxophone I will give you free lessons
someguy_matt: FE needs a better title department
Landalin: Yeah for sure
StreaminLeeman: WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY WOOBLY
SSVick: you can get 2 paths in one route
SSVick: aight, gotta sleep good night everyone Bedge
StreaminLeeman: My head is ringing KEKW
Landalin: depends on what level you get, but a good one probably between 1-3l lol
Landalin: 1-3k*
StreaminLeeman: Nah, it's still going, I don't think it'll be fixed until Monday LUL
someguy_matt: @StreaminLeeman somegu34Hi
StreaminLeeman: Matt! somegu34Dance
shakadactyl: Don’t be too hard on yourself with Japanese. You ARE learning THREE writing systems.
StreaminLeeman: We actually went into the door and found where the speaker is because we were so annoyed at one point LUL
Landalin: fair enough they're expensive
StreaminLeeman: Thankfully I only had to stay at that desk until 6
StreaminLeeman: It was 4 hours of that tho KEKW
StreaminLeeman: I drowned it out with Youtube sound
shakadactyl: And even some of the Japanese people I lived and worked with couldn’t remember all the Kanji.
shakadactyl: It made me feel less bad.
Landalin: Mine is $2k but was a sick deal because this particular model was a very close competitor to the "holy grail" of saxophones that go for at least 6k, maybe 10 depending on condition
Landalin: EXIT THE DOOR
StreaminLeeman: KEKW
Landalin: Its not brass its woodwind but yeah I get you
shakadactyl: Lol, for Chinese, you have to know, like 50k. For Japanese, if you know 2k, you’re considered “fluent.” But you can get buy with just 1k.
e_mcsqrd: it uses a reed. trumpet, trombone, etc. are brass
Landalin: brass is like trumpet, trombone, tuba, etc
e_mcsqrd: reed = woodwind
Landalin: yeah what e_mcsqrd said
Landalin: except flute
Landalin: flute has no reed but it is still a woodwind
e_mcsqrd: oh ya!! flute!  i forgot about that one lol
Landalin: no idea tbh
Landalin: but yeah woodwinds are saxophone, clarinet, flute
shakadactyl: Exactly! Language learning IS a lifelong process. The goal shouldn’t be “to get fluent.”
StreaminLeeman: LUL
Landalin: and then you have double reeds like oboe and bassoon
StreaminLeeman: johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers johnlu4Hypers
StreaminLeeman: I feel your pain dude, it's so hard to get thru an MGS run without a bathroom break LUL
e_mcsqrd: @Landalin is oboe woodwind?
shakadactyl: I told my students that all the time
StreaminLeeman: KEKW
StreaminLeeman: johnlu4Dance
Landalin: yes but a double reed woodwind
Landalin: i think
shakadactyl: Just because we’re native speakers of our respective mother tongues, it doesn’t mean that we know everything about it or are perfect.
Landalin: idk classification is ultimately arbitrary so who really cares
Landalin: "instrument sound good me like"
shakadactyl: Tbf, cilantro is a borrowed/loan word anyways, so LUL
shakadactyl: Loanwords are always pronounced differently than where it comes from
a_n_i_v: how much trivia someone has played
shakadactyl: *where they
Landalin: @a_n_i_v stfu nerd
shakadactyl: ハムバーガー
e_mcsqrd: i do bar trivia every monday evening!
Landalin: i'm great at trivia at certain topics and i watched a lot of jeopardy
jellyfish_trifle: Plant Daddy
Landalin: so probably mid tier
StreaminLeeman: I played that the other day!
StreaminLeeman: jellyfish_trifle gamblo4Wave
shakadactyl: ハムバーガー Sounds different than hamburger SeemsGood
e_mcsqrd: i'm terrible....i'm the science, math, medicine and music theory guy
jellyfish_trifle: All good, thanks. Just playing some Elden Ring
StreaminLeeman: I thought it was pretty neat terror107Yay
Landalin: my dad always ran every single sports category on jeopardy
Landalin: @e_mcsqrd oooo music theory me likie
shakadactyl: (Ha-mu-baa-gaa) = ハムバーガー =hamburger
e_mcsqrd: @Landalin are you a musician?
Landalin: Yeah I played saxophone for years and major'd in jazz studies on scholarship before i got burnt out and switched majors
jellyfish_trifle: 7?
shakadactyl: Too many
StreaminLeeman: I'm gonna say 11
someguy_matt: 9?
StreaminLeeman: God, that's tough, there was so many of those little expansion ones and gameboy ones LUL
someguy_matt: is there two DS ones?
shakadactyl: 20
StreaminLeeman: Like Liberty City Stories and shit
StreaminLeeman: 17 jazselHmm

Landalin: I can also play flute and clarinet to a decent degree and I can play basic piano chords for comping
Otakaru: Wait! This isn't Final Corntasy XIV: Enddilly!
Landalin: I'm okay now not super in practice but i used to be ok
StreaminLeeman: I loved San Andreas, I think I'd go with that
Landalin: err good maybe
StreaminLeeman: Ota verosWaving
e_mcsqrd: @Landalin music can be rough to study and the industry is hard. i studied science, but i'm a composer (piano) and songwriter on the side
someguy_matt: @Otakaru Father
Otakaru: @Otakaru otakarPog
Otakaru: just chillin
Landalin: @e_mcsqrd i was much more on the improvisation side rather than composition. i always felt my ideas for compositions were dumb lol
e_mcsqrd: hahaha I'll write you one dude....one day lol
Landalin: as a jazz guy
StreaminLeeman: GG deebicYay
KatMakes: HypeLurk
Landalin: vice city will always have that special place in my heart
StreaminLeeman: 5 has some really neat created game modes and stuff too
StreaminLeeman: Yeah, I wonder if they were careful with 4 because they didn't want to strain the 360/PS3
StreaminLeeman: Yeah, a lot of the race tracks and stuff are pretty sick
StreaminLeeman: Oh yeah you're right!
StreaminLeeman: I used to love that stuff
Landalin: honestly every progressive game in the series "SHOULD" be the best one
Landalin: otherwise why release an inferior product to what you did before
StreaminLeeman: KEKW
FDotFDot: godess4DISGUSTED
FDotFDot: godess4LUL
someguy_matt: halo reach was sick when i was in middle school
Landalin: again the main word is "SHOULD"
FDotFDot: Halo Reach was sick af
e_mcsqrd: @e_mcsqrd love that you did improv. my piano composition ideas are nauseatingly emotional and simple.
baddiebec: Matt, couldn't agree more! That was my gameeee nikdudLove
Landalin: yo shout outs to zombie maps on halo 2 while eating pizza all night with your homies
Landalin: true nostalgia
StreaminLeeman: Bec braryPog

shakadactyl: Is Dragon Quest similar to Chrono Trigger?
princesstrunks996: im good ty hope ur well @NikDudeN7 @jellyfish_trifle
Landalin: especially with turn based stuff, not like there is any sort of mechanics element, so strategy is kind of the only point

king_omni: It has consumed my free time
king_omni: I've gotten to the second phase of Hades and died immediately
king_omni: I figured there would be because it's Hades, so there's bound to be some BS that happens
king_omni: I've only beaten Theses once, and that was the run that ended at Hades. I used the rail gun with the triple shot boon
king_omni: I only like that build because no reloading
king_omni: What boons do you have? The bow is doing absurd damage
king_omni: Oh yeah, followed by spear and shield
king_omni: I think so
king_omni: I've learn to never pick against Artemis. She is unforgiving.
king_omni: You're getting hit by a mob of enemies plus she's shooting a lot of arrows at you

MR_CRASH87: Welcome Raiders kikiswDankthomas
ChuckG997: This is my first playthru, tho I watched my wife play it so I know the story... we're trying to play along with the show
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Can confirm Chuck is the man!
ChuckG997: Yeah, tonight we played the events of ep6 from this past Sunday and next Monday we'll play ep7
jellyfish_trifle: @jellyfish_trifle You never forget your first! I think ER is a gentler introduction to the genre but you'll really struggle to go back to DS1 after it. They added a lot of QOL improvements between DS1 and ER.
MDarkGuard01: ladyve3Koalachainsaw  fun stream for tomorrow Kappa
ChuckG997: Yeah
ChuckG997: LUL @Shaun_Da_Bomb if you say so
ChuckG997: @MDarkGuard01 redeemed for me to play Visage tomorrow NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 bro you ride dirt bikes and own a bad ass sports car
ChuckG997: I have not played Subnautica but it looks awesome and it's on my list. I want to play it in VR
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Also, has great streams
StreaminLeeman: @jellyfish_trifle That is kind of what I'm thinking as well! Like I know the combat seems cleaner in ER but DS1 seems like such a fun experience to try. Plus I've been watching a couple people do hit-less and the bosses seem cool as hell
ChuckG997: I don't stream too many Horror games... I played Visage last halloween but didn't get all the way thru it
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 hes at the very end of the game so just a heads up
Metallichepe: im looking for the fungus and the bulb
ChuckG997: @Shaun_Da_Bomb Thanks for that, btw the next dirt bike video is gunna be awesome
Metallichepe: i mean bulb
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @jellyfish_trifle Im sorry I let u down in Halo brother
ChuckG997: Oh thank you, yeah I do wanna avoid them spoilers
ChuckG997: I was exhausted, and had other horror games I had to play
ChuckG997: Cool cool, I gotta run and get some stuff done anyway
jellyfish_trifle: @StreaminLeeman The interconnectivity of the world is still amazing but there's some stuff like long runs back to retry bosses that gets old quickly
ChuckG997: I've got a few redemptions in the queue, I'm also playing Fallout4 DLC right now
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ChuckG997 Im getting close to FF7 Kappa
Shaun_Da_Bomb: IMO Fallout 3
MDarkGuard01: You getting ready to shower Nik? Kappa
ChuckG997: I heard FO3 is the fan favorite, but I haven't played it yet
MR_CRASH87: Fallout 69 is great
StreaminLeeman: @jellyfish_trifle Oof Yeah I even noticed with Taurus Demon it was a bit of a walk, although I still get lost occasionally so that may have contributed LUL
jellyfish_trifle: @Shaun_Da_Bomb It's not your fault, Shaun. The OG Dream Team was too powerful to be left together Sadge
StreaminLeeman: I looooooved Fallout 3
baddiebec: !home
ChuckG997: Alright, I'm out of here, enjoy end of Subnautica!
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @MR_CRASH87 Fallout 420 is fantastic. They really got the smoke effects down in that one

MR_CRASH87: @shaun_da_bomb some 420 mixed with 69 sounds about right to me 😎👀
a_n_i_v: You got this and that much time loss
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @MR_CRASH87 soooo Fallout 489?
MR_CRASH87: That’s perfect @shaun_da_bomb 👀
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Up to you homie!
MDarkGuard01: you getting scared? Kappa
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Id prefer a longer stream but if youre tired u can call it early
MR_CRASH87: The Last Of Us
MDarkGuard01: how about something good Kappa
ErrorBorn: Gal Gun
MDarkGuard01: not mario games Kappa
ErrorBorn: I've heard good things

MR_CRASH87: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, The Last Of Us, & Dead Space
Metallichepe: ligma
StreaminLeeman: LUL
jellyfish_trifle: TLoU is good. Or Fallout.
StreaminLeeman: Each Phoenix Wright is prob around like 15-20 hours I think
StreaminLeeman: There's a trilogy collection on steam/modern consoles braryHypies
jellyfish_trifle: I think New Vegas has more interesting quests so probably more interesting to stream? But 3 is great too.
a_n_i_v: how hard it is :)
MR_CRASH87: Bro I probably came afterwards lol cause I never seen you stream that
StreaminLeeman: It's been a while so my memory is fuzzy but not crazy difficult imo

StreaminLeeman: sholziHmm Yes yes

Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL Id rather not
StreaminLeeman: mx3Sip
StreaminLeeman: LUL
MDarkGuard01: to make you suffer, people enjoy that Kappa
ErrorBorn: Because I don't drink enough water so it makes me feel better when other people drink enough for me
MDarkGuard01: bc is nice seeing other people suffer? no? only me? okay Kappa
ErrorBorn: Idk ... I probably drink a cup that holds 30oz like twice a day
Shaun_Da_Bomb: WutFace
Shaun_Da_Bomb: "cute"

Metallichepe: LMFAO

LightAligns: oh no hahaha
Shaun_Da_Bomb: !rekt
LightAligns: I'm fucking cackling a bit right now honestly
MR_CRASH87: Was going good at first
MetalCrazy666: I had a lot less grey beard and hair LUL
Landalin: i looked like a little schoolboy bitch
MR_CRASH87: What @landalin LUL LUL LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I was mid because I just existed and got along with every one lol
LightAligns: it definitely requires more concentration
e_mcsqrd: yo man! What's goin on?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
e_mcsqrd: It was a snow day...so I had a free day.  Played a bit of mario.  Started a standard non-kaizo hack.  It's good...but I like kaizo more
baddiebec: Gears
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Like, I wasnt always cool enough to go to all the "cool kids" parties but like I hung out with everyone. Didnt matter who they really were.
LightAligns: sons of the forest is out
baddiebec: nikdudSmile
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I wanna see an unhinged Nik
MR_CRASH87: That’s another survival game right
LightAligns: I enjoyed the forest because I played it with someone.  as a solo, it wouldn't have been fun for me
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @NikDudeN7 just at gears lol
e_mcsqrd: It's Mario vs the Deadly Alliance
Landalin: sounds like rust
LightAligns: yeah we built on the beach so it wasn't an issue
MinisterGold: Yo whats up Nik
MR_CRASH87: Mario getting bashed in the head by moloch & Drahmin
MinisterGold: tank ya. Yea made some decent progress
MinisterGold: How's the kaizo going
MinisterGold: yup yup. just coding per usual
Shaun_Da_Bomb: BTW. What a disappointing State of Play
MR_CRASH87: Deadly Alliance came up and I just thought about those 2 characters ahaha
a_n_i_v: slower than heavy restricted (maybe I should have found poop days later find anyone
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean...
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Sorry Sony employee... it was mid
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
MR_CRASH87: I agree @shaun_da_bomb
MR_CRASH87: I was sitting there bored watching it looking up at the ceiling
MinisterGold: hmm... so i was pretty reserved. Didn't have too many friends. Very studious. Kind of just coming out of a bubble. Nerdy outcast
MinisterGold: hbu
Landalin: in all seriousness i was a band nerdge but had a good amount of friends from that and classes
Landalin: yeah thats how honors classes were with me
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I was never in the same class with the same people
Shaun_Da_Bomb: My class had like 500 people in it
Landalin: I still play saxophone
Shaun_Da_Bomb: No my class lol
Landalin: it means his grade
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL it might have been closer to 400
KarishmaXX: yo 😂😂😂
MinisterGold: ah and yea i was in a new HS at the time, so i was in the first graduating class, so that was cool
Landalin: so like 12th grade had 500 people
Shaun_Da_Bomb: ^^^
MinisterGold: also, driving into my school looked like a prison
KarishmaXX: but how
KarishmaXX: that has to be american
MinisterGold: Yo Shaun minist22HatWave
Shaun_Da_Bomb: What up Goldddddd
MR_CRASH87: My high school looked like an assembly building
Shaun_Da_Bomb: We only had 1 highschool
Landalin: yeah we call our graduating year "class of 2010" or whatever
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL we call the course a class haha
KarishmaXX: so thats why teachers cant focus on their students
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I SEEEEEEEEEE
KarishmaXX: ohh so u mean the entire grade is called a class
MinisterGold: this is getting less confusing fast
Landalin: yes
baddiebec: LUL @karishmaxx
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL this is why our education system is failing haha
MinisterGold: bec dangilWave
HometownTeam: Wow - I never thought about how weird it is that we call a course a class and also your year in school also a class. Dang.
MR_CRASH87: Ahahahaha
Landalin: edjumacation
baddiebec: Hiya Gold! lepHEY
MinisterGold: HI hi
KarishmaXX: ya so  there were 500 ppl in my grade
Shaun_Da_Bomb: No no no so general years were called grades
KarishmaXX: but diff classes
Shaun_Da_Bomb: But I was specifically just talking about my graduating CLASS
KarishmaXX: like 20 classes for 1 grade
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
baddiebec: LUL
Landalin: then what do you call your scores that you get in your class? grades have 2 meaning then too
HometownTeam: Leave it to the Canadians to make us feel weird! 🤣🤣😂 JK
baddiebec: Merica lepS
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I mean technically but people dont say 11th class they say 11th grade. Class is specifically just the year you graduate lol
HometownTeam: Is first year not Freshman year?!
Otakaru: nik there are new people in grade 9 every year. so the people you move with to year 10 are part of your graduating class
Landalin: @HometownTeam yes for us mericans
Otakaru: sorry grade 10 not year
KarishmaXX: nik can u play plant daddy for crow to hear
e_mcsqrd: we also call them marks...and grades
baddiebec: !plant
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @Otakaru yup
HometownTeam: I’m also American - wondering what other countries call first year
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL
Shaun_Da_Bomb: What
Landalin: freshman sophmore junior senior
Landalin: lmao
KarishmaXX: FRESHMORE AND SOFTMEN

Shaun_Da_Bomb: Softman
MR_CRASH87: I’m weak
baddiebec: LUL
HometownTeam: This is too much - I’m confusing myself just thinking about it
MR_CRASH87: You tryna kill me
Otakaru: @Shaun_Da_Bomb lol sounds like Nik Kappa
e_mcsqrd: LUL
KarishmaXX: we only hear these things in Movies
Landalin: this is so much semantics about school lmao
Shaun_Da_Bomb: LUL cant remember the order... while making up two of them
baddiebec: this is true. we only know this through movies
Landalin: study the movies more then Nik
KarishmaXX: so ur watchers r in america
MinisterGold: to be fair, i have no idea why we even use these terms
KarishmaXX: i mean usa
KarishmaXX: can u ask them abt shoes in house
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Softman was my least favorite year
KarishmaXX: 😂😂
baddiebec: LMAO @karishmaxx you're killing meee
HometownTeam: School is BS - tell that to my student loans
MR_CRASH87: I can’t stop laughing softman
baddiebec: when I hear junior I do think 1st year
Landalin: i usually take my shoes off in the house
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Sometimes
someguy_matt: and if you wear your shoes inside where do you take them off
someguy_matt: where's the line
Shaun_Da_Bomb: In my own house I take them off
Landalin: but fresh man. as in fresh and new
LightAligns: we wear house shoes in houses.  but we drive on parkways and park in driveways
e_mcsqrd: when I was a first year medical resident, i was a junior
HometownTeam: Junior is less than senior
KarishmaXX: when Justin Bieber first moved to states they asked him if he eas a softmore or what and he had no idea how to answer
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I feel like it would be weird going over to someones house and just take them off unless they kind of bring up that I can leave them somewhere
Otakaru: i think junior/senior are relics from when only grades 11 and 12 were considered high school
Landalin: glad to learn some Bieber lore
Landalin: I just take my shoes off right at the door to not track in mess into the house
KarishmaXX: is it bc it doesnt snow in the states thats why they wear their shoes inside
KarishmaXX: is inside always dusty then??
HometownTeam: Wait! @otakaru high school used to only be juniors and seniors?!
baddiebec: it snows in American @karishmaxx lepPRAY
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @HometownTeam Thats correct
Landalin: In American
baddiebec: IM STRESSED OK @landalin LUL LUL
HometownTeam: I gotta Google that because it is news!
Landalin: Nik you walk around stepping in shit all the time or what?
a_n_i_v: where are the patch notes bro
someguy_matt: i would always hear parents asked who tracked mud into the house in shows
baddiebec: @a_n_i_v exactly
HometownTeam: Yes
LightAligns: listen.  you have to build up immunities somehow.  just track all that garbage into your house
someguy_matt: and i was always like who the fuck is wearing their shoes inside
Otakaru: @HometownTeam we don't need facts to tell nik stories Kappa
LightAligns: put your feet up on the kitchen counter with shoes on
baddiebec: @lightaligns Imma cry
Shaun_Da_Bomb: So okay... if u were going over to someones house that u dont know well... u still take your shoes off going to their house?
Landalin: you saying fecal matter is killing me
someguy_matt: yes
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Yeah... idk
LightAligns: not to mention how old I am, but I wear slippers inside haha.  but I don't wear shoes inside
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Definitely not that way here
HometownTeam: I don’t wear shoes in the house at all - and I don’t have people over that don’t take theirs off
KarishmaXX: when i saw american shows wearing shoes inside i thought it was fake until i started watching american lives on IG
someguy_matt: maybe canadians don't have foot fetishes so its not weird exposing the puppers
Shaun_Da_Bomb: What if u go to a house party?
KarishmaXX: also why does it matter how well u know someone whether u take ur shoes off
Landalin: It also might differ from state to state. cause everywhere I go everyone takes off their shoes
someguy_matt: you know how shittly the floor would be in the winter if we left our shoes on
KarishmaXX: and yes if theres a house party u still take them off
baddiebec: @shaun_da_bomb you take them off. pile em on top of them lol
LightAligns: depends on the house party
someguy_matt: yeah i take them off
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @LightAligns KEKW
Landalin: cause what if they're gonna steal your shoes at the party bro?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Because I feel like its almost like, literally "making yourself at home" if u take youre shoes off
KarishmaXX: if ur trashing the house leave shoes on
baddiebec: I wear a size 4in kids so so one touching ma shoes LUL

KarishmaXX: the ppl who wears shoes inside in Canada are usually trashy or hoodmans
LightAligns: there used to be an old punk house in the middle of the woods that put on house shows all the time.  they didn't let anyone in who kept their shoes on
baddiebec: hoodmannnsss
SayYestotheJes: it's a lil weird lil spooky but i LOVE IT so far!!

KarishmaXX: LMFOAOAOAAO
history83: Hey Bec I have been lurking while playing games so I am in and out
KarishmaXX: LOL YES TO JESS
HometownTeam: Filters for sure @karishmaxx - you couldn’t pay me to drink tap water
shakadactyl: I think it depends on the family, honestly.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @KarishmaXX We apparently dont have water
baddiebec: I get ya @history83 lepCH
a_n_i_v: id pay 99.99 for pass or 6 apiece
LightAligns: @karishmaxx I installed a reverse osmosis filtration system.   I won't drink the tap water here
SayYestotheJes: i only raid my friends BabyRage so obvi I raided where Bec is Kappa
shakadactyl: You guys drink water? WutFace
baddiebec: LUL @shakadactyl
Landalin: fecal particle water

Landalin: is that Flint?

Shaun_Da_Bomb: @Landalin flint Michigan yes sir lol jk
KarishmaXX: i keep picturing a house party here where ppl keep their shoes on n the place is SOAKING in black water from the melted snow
history83: getting a little lost but working it out
Landalin: @Landalin loooooooooooool
SayYestotheJes: @LightAligns YES to this, my parents live in Memphis and their tap water is SO GOOD
SayYestotheJes: but here in East TN, I can't drink our tap water BLECH
KarishmaXX: whoooaa memphiss waterr
KarishmaXX: 😂😂😂😂😂
HometownTeam: Cryptosporidium is a bacteria that makes you have to boil your water before any kind of use
shakadactyl: My old school used well water. It had a sweet aftertaste to it.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Na in the instance where like, obviously the shoes are gonna make a mess then yes we take them off lol
history83: @KarishmaXX If you live in a state that has snow you take your shoes off when you get in the house here in the states
LightAligns: memphis water is definitely some of the cleanest in the us.  actually tastes different
Landalin: @HometownTeam sounds like a crypto shitcoin
Shaun_Da_Bomb: We dont mind a little fecal matter

shakadactyl: Dead bodies sweetened the water
SayYestotheJes: @shakadactyl BARF
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Bruh I hate having to put my shoes back on. Thats why I keep them tight enough to stay on my feel but loose enough to just slip back on lol
baddiebec: I FEEL SICK @shakadactyl LUL
shakadactyl: Keepo
MR_CRASH87: Don’t go to the fridge nik
KarishmaXX: i have to go to gym
LightAligns: another question - if you're holding your phone and you have to tie your shoes, do you put your phone in your mouth for a moment while you tie them?
MetalCrazy666: ajsDoc ajsDoc ajsDoc
KarishmaXX: but i wanna know abt the canada and states differences
Landalin: what no i put it in my pocket
baddiebec: @lightaligns in your mouth?!?! whyyy
LightAligns: I don't.   I see people do it
shakadactyl: But in all seriousness, the well was covered. Not just left out for anyone to dump crap in.
KarishmaXX: Lightalifbs
history83: @LightAligns no that is why you get slip on shoes
KarishmaXX: lightaligns
LightAligns: same with money.  fucking disgusts me
baddiebec: @lightaligns thank god I panicked for a min
KarishmaXX: thats hard no unless u sanitize ur phone everyday
KarishmaXX: i put it between my legs
history83: Here is a question all! Do you use your phone while in a public restroom?
LightAligns: I prefer my e coli directly from a petrie dish
KarishmaXX: LOL
HometownTeam: I try to never use a public bathroom
baddiebec: same @karishmaxx
Landalin: with sound off sure history
baddiebec: LUL yo sameeee @hometownteam
KarishmaXX: i try not to use my phone in public washrooms but thats personal i feel like most ppl dont care how gross it is
shakadactyl: WutFace
history83: @Landalin really why? I am asking not judging promise
e_mcsqrd: i've heard smarties are the same thing as rockets in the states
MetalCrazy666: Here's a diference from Portugal to USA, Spain, France, Germany, etc. Most of these countries dub everything: movies are dubbed to their language, games are dubbed, anime is dubbed. In Portugal we don't have dub culture, we only dub kids cartoons and shows, cause most may not know how to read
MR_CRASH87: Public bathrooms are a nightmare
KarishmaXX: no wayyy thats interesting
MetalCrazy666: So I can't watch dubs cause I'm not used to it, I watch everything in OG language
baddiebec: Nik you literally used a public bathrm on Sunday Kappa
shakadactyl: You guys are squatters in an old building? Keepo
MR_CRASH87: Abandoned? That’s creepy
baddiebec: guys. is it bathroom or restroom?
history83: Wait Nik if there is no one else in the building is there a cleaning crew that cleans the other levels?
KarishmaXX: GOOD Q BADDIE
HometownTeam: It’s ok for guys to use public bathrooms but we have to sit down and that’s just NO
MetalCrazy666: Subs NODDERS
KarishmaXX: in canada we say washroom
baddiebec: THANKSSSS KARISH
Shaun_Da_Bomb: Washroom...
MR_CRASH87: I say public restroom
history83: @HometownTeam what about portajohns?
Shaun_Da_Bomb: I randomly switch between restroom and bathroom
shakadactyl: Because there used to be chairs where you could sit and chill Kappa
KarishmaXX: mr crash 4 syllables just to go pee
HometownTeam: I would rather pee on myself @history83
KarishmaXX: PORTAJOHNS 😂
HometownTeam: I’d still be cleaner
history83: @HometownTeam HAHA
history83: @KarishmaXX yes it is a portable toilet that is used outside
MR_CRASH87: @karishmaxx piss in every toilet 🚽 yes
a_n_i_v: it's only insecurity with that strat though
shakadactyl: "The term restroom came from the fact that in early 1900s up-scale restaurants, theatres and performing facilities would often have comfortable chairs or sofas located within or in a room directly adjacent to the actual toilet and sink facilities. Technically people do rest there because they are sitting down."
KarishmaXX: we call portajohns "portapotties""
baddiebec: I think I say bathroom...?
Otakaru: bowser
KarishmaXX: whoaa cool to know
shakadactyl: Some places where I live still have sitting rooms in the restrooms
MR_CRASH87: That’s interesting
history83: @KarishmaXX oh yea they are interchangeable for sure

cd0h: @raincoated the cinematography in those shots, chef's kiss
cd0h: honestly they're all as bad as one another these days
rubajub_warhorn: For awhile, basically
MetalCrazy666: The company's name is Activision/Blizzard
TASagent: Stack Ranking Trash
MetalCrazy666: Microsoft should fire all CEO's
MetalCrazy666: IF they buy
raincoated: @raincoated thank u. i live for the cinematography screenies on FF its all i do on it

TASagent: You know I _did_ effectively make my own livesplit, right?
TASagent: My split timer is my bot
TASagent: The bot reports the timer values in cumulative milliseconds, and the overlay translates it in javascript. So it'd be easy to do
TASagent: Oh, it doesn't support proper splits
TASagent: I've used my timer for my QW1 and QW2 races, which I submitted
TASagent: they don't care what you time im
TASagent: lol
TASagent: yeah, I burned out on it, but only after I had a few orbital platforms and auto resource export set up
TASagent: Oh, lol. I think I finished all T2's
facebug: You’re quite the connoisseur of hoodies nik, but do you rock any pull overs?
facebug: Not a zip up

One night during a break between songs when it was quiet with no vibrations, a stack of cds that were on the table just flew across the room
MDarkGuard01: ah yes only google Kappa

ShadowPandaaaa: HI HOME
home_wrecker: hello Panda
MR_CRASH87: camping is fun as long as i dont see a big ass grizzly bear or wolves

MR_CRASH87: the white patch they have near their eyes freaks me out not to mention how big they're and how fast they swim. Free Willy even creeps me out and that was a family movie LUL
ShadowPandaaaa: naaahhh
ShadowPandaaaa: youre suppose to drink like 1/3 your body weight in water
LightAligns: Another short story.  Went camping in a forest called happy valley in Central NY.  We got a bad feeling at like 2 and decided to leave.   Tried to drive our car out and there and all the lights in my car started dimming and getting bright.  Car almost died a couple times and as soon as we pulled out onto the road it went back to normal
gorpo_c: nah i don't think so
Metallichepe: jesus lights
MDarkGuard01: sounds like a battery problem Kappa
MDarkGuard01: maybe getting cold Kappa
MR_CRASH87: that's creepy
history83: @LightAligns that is where you roll down the window and shout at the top of your lungs "NOT TODAY SATAIN" and they will leave you alone
baddiebec: LUL History

baddiebec: LUL panda just wants to make sure you're always hydrated
MDarkGuard01: to have nice effects?
ShadowPandaaaa: crying for your losses
baddiebec: panda. In the summer, do you want me to get Nik to put the plant hat on. Then go outside and I'll throw a water balloon at him?
LightAligns: There are a few droplets throughout the level
MR_CRASH87: the more you drink the more you'll take a piss in the haunted toilet
baddiebec: nikdudSmile nikdudSmile nikdudSmile nikdudSmile
baddiebec: !plant

ShadowPandaaaa: there are reusable waterbaloons
MDarkGuard01: is it based on the movie, waterworld? Kappa

LightAligns: *me
history83: It is as long as my foot
history83: I dont know how long my arm is sorry
saela253: it is
MR_CRASH87: !home
baddiebec: Brb! Going into lurk
history83: I posted a picture in discord Nik of my forearm
history83: No it is not
history83: do you now
history83: how cool is that
history83: I am thinking of getting some tattoo's on my arm some time soon
LightAligns: I can tell you it's not that haha
saela253: you have to play all exits again but with low gravity
history83: umm I want to do a tribute to my grandmother's and grandfather's
LightAligns: I don't think you found the pressure water hidden level in this yet though
tm00n: Bowsieeeeeeee
tm00n: winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE winter273BowserHYPE
history83: I know for one grandma would be flowers, maybe a breast cancer ribbon for the other grandma
saela253: i really can't stop thinking about a low gravity level with this asm
saela253: people might lose their minds
LightAligns: Kappa
history83: for my grandfathers I would do an Airforce tattoo and an Army tatttoo
tm00n: It’s been a goodge day. How are you neek dewd?
history83: Hi Moon
saela253: yeah but...low gravity where you have to do all the inputs
saela253: ?
MR_CRASH87: ello @tm00n :D HeyGuys
saela253: that should be pretty fucked
tm00n: @history83 highli25Wave
history83: Hey Nik do you not see that door right next to you at the start point?
LightAligns: It's an input playback level where you actually jump anytime you let go of jump instead of pressing jump
tm00n: @mr_crash87 nikdudHand nikdudHand
history83: oh ok
saela253: my god light
tm00n: Not much today. I worked hella early and then played AC all day
saela253: that actually sounds fun
LightAligns: Regrabs are done by not holding jump
history83: how fun is that Moon the whole playing AC all day
LightAligns: It depends.   Cursed where it's still fun?  Or just cursed where people would hate us?
saela253: disco riding to the left with reverse controls
LightAligns: You just let go of the button completely to do a full jump
tm00n: Today it was tedious cause my inventory is nearly full so I spend most of the day sifting through all of my hoarded shit seeing what I could get rid of
LightAligns: We have joked about cursed where people would hate us.   I'd have to look for old ideas haha
saela253: we had some pretty messed up ideas
a_n_i_v: Ty is crushing of tea  after i finish this and bloodlines fit in that train of thought turbo was cheating so uh yeah you must’ve picked up upon acquiring these fools the trader joes burrito atm
history83: ok then aniv
tm00n: Buncha furniture
LightAligns: We did have a setup with 1f0s and and noteblocks where the key you would have to ride to beat the level moved at about..  a pixel a second
LightAligns: We actually have a discord channel with level ideas for that hack hahaha
tm00n: I can send you things Nik but you gotta add me as your best friendge
saela253: i had an idea once of mario not being able to jump and there would be two mega moles next to each other walking right....and it would be ice physics....so you would have to to run left and right on the moles to avoid shit falling from the sky.....problem was it was too easy to fall down inbetween the moles
LightAligns: It's like a a healthy outlet for ridiculous ideas
LightAligns: We also had a level idea where every sprite was resigned to be a different sprite.  So you couldn't rely on regular jumps or spin jumps anymore to jump off them
LightAligns: And another that was just named "oops, all spritekillers"
saela253: actually the original idea for road not taken would have been pretty cursed too
LightAligns: Yeah, and we almost did that haha
saela253: final level of ascension
LightAligns: I mean... Ascension 1.0 water level was pretty cursed according to some
tm00n: Well I’m at the point in the DLC where I can customize my villagers houses on my actual island so I’ve been doing those

BaggageID: I am a university student - so I don't work-work
saela253: one of the rooms should also have automatic fast swim
ratatremy: Yo @NikDudeN7
saela253: oh yes
eejay: @LightAligns barbStare
LightAligns: Also timed on/off mechanism that changes your d pad controls

BaggageID: I think o7 is better than o/ because the second one kinda looks wrong dangilSweat
eejay: v! eejayPls
LightAligns: That's like mirc and usenet stuff
BaggageID: What is the origin of o7? According to Crossing Zebras, these were created from a need in the game EVE to communicate and be personable. It is assumed that the other players will be threatening, so a need for nice communication was born. This is also used in other games like Elite Dangerous. thilda1Nerd
tm00n: Sorry neek we had to give the baby kitty an emergency bath
BaggageID: looks like EVE is from 2003, Elite Dangerous apparently from 2014

history83: my first alarm is set for 425am then 435am and I dont get out of bed until 445am to leave the house by 510am

EyeOdin: but I am not making a fighting game first
EyeOdin: need to make easyer game
EyeOdin: platformer
Dynamic_Gravity: did a cursory google, enzyme to react-testing doesn't look awesome. Just mostly skip the wrapper and instead es6 imports the specific context so you should be fine

MetalCrazy666: Like 4 5 drops, rub on the hands and apply it on beard
Dynamic_Gravity: Well, it starts with a clean beard. Gotta brush out the bed beard, then a few drops of the oil is enough
MetalCrazy666: Exactly Nik
MR_CRASH87: Yeah I’ll put it in the server
baddiebec: Oh yeah good question @metalcrazy666 I assume it's like nice and moistizing
e_mcsqrd: I do the whole beard thing too.  It's a lot of work...but I'm a fan.

Cliff_C718: returnal is very close to doom and metroid
savagehenre: cant get enough shoot
Dynamic_Gravity: @Cliff_C718 I'd argue more. I eat a lot of butter and it would get all in my beard constantly
savagehenre: skoot*
Cliff_C718: @savagehenre fcts beard freedom is essential
e_mcsqrd: if i shaved my beard off, i'd look way too young and none of my students would take me seriously
Dynamic_Gravity: "hello, fellow kids"
Cliff_C718: @Dynamic_Gravity what you gotta get is the beard guard that covers it while you eat
savagehenre: skoot does such a  good job with all aspects
Dynamic_Gravity: @Cliff_C718 or those teacups with a mustache guard
Cliff_C718: whats so funny is that Kitt has banned me from cutting off my beard lol. i am screwed for the summer lol
savagehenre: papaya
baddiebec: See women use makeup to look diff. Men use beards nikdudRavealina

TaddyMason74: Cheer69 Just sucks that we were so close to Apple using Gecko (Firefox rendering engine). But they chose KHTML instead as the base for their rendering engine that eventually turned into WebKit. When Google first launched Chrome, they used WebKit but eventually developed Blink (rendering engine for Chromium based browsers [ex. Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc]). We were so close to not having to deal with fragmentation in the way browsers render but they ended up going their separate ways.
Elsaiz117: Photosynthesis me

ThirdWall: Left hand milk stout is a classic
jellyfish_trifle: I don't *drink* 5 a day. I have 5 fruit or veg a day. And cider is just apple juice, so it counts as 1.
TheUCanes: Founders Breakfast stout is good
FDotFDot: KEKW

ThirdWall: This was devastating
ThirdWall: https://clips.twitch.tv/EnchantingCoyAppleRickroll-PepTOll-wEW9yFU8
krool_gamer: nuts and bolts was not enjoyed BECAUSE it was banjo but not the banjo everyone wanted. if it hadn't been banjo, it'd probably had been received better
someguy_matt: dude the mission structure lets you build literally anything you want to beat it
ThirdWall: Photosensitivity warning on that clip
ThirdWall: Like big time

loc0lob0: ...God..Gamer
jellyfish_trifle: !gamer
history83: @loc0lob0 I am liking it so far and I have never touched a souls game
history83: Nik you were watching me play it the other day

a_n_i_v: sneaky wokenpL
mastertank56: more customization then diablo but less than PoE
SeeFooBoo: ok nik I have a question about the surge, is the augmented edition worth $2 cause the Surge is 2.99 on steam rn
mastertank56: they've been in beta for awhile and just released their multiplayer
betterCallSalt_: Can't golf tonight but that was tempting
mastertank56: they're exceptionally transparent about their development and also listen to the community a ton
SeeFooBoo: Nice sell. Up to you $2.99 is real cheap
mastertank56: i'm going for a build that I just kill everything with a swarm of squirrels
betterCallSalt_: You never know they are  the old days until they are gone
mastertank56: you get summon wolf but there's a unique that halves their damage but doubles the amount of summons and turns them into squirrels
betterCallSalt_: asaltrLurk  have a great stream!
mastertank56: and they do a shit ton of bleed and physical resist tear
mastertank56: the unique actually gives them even more health
mastertank56: it's really fucking good
history83: Hey Nik guess what game I played today?
history83: Iratus
mastertank56: and the buddy I'm running with wants to level up the same class once I get mine running so we can just have double the squirrels
history83: I am liking it so far have no clue what I am doing but hey who needs to know how to play a game right, right?
mastertank56: it'll be.....nuts Kappa
mastertank56: it's a post level 70 drop only so it's pretty end game

MR_CRASH87: Eating some chocolate chip cookies now and just relaxing for the night
SeeFooBoo: into the switch and down
someguy_matt: there's a new ffxv mobie game that was being advertised on tiktok like every shitty mobie game so i made a video ranting about it
SeeFooBoo: H
a_n_i_v: it's all good MingLee

SeeFooBoo: yeah I just chilling watching your stream deciding if I have energy to get into a game
someguy_matt: like its dog shit
history83: I just saw that ad today Matt
someguy_matt: if that was the first ffxvi game people would be upset
MR_CRASH87: Yeah no nuts just regular chocolate chip
someguy_matt: but they don't care about xv
someguy_matt: you want me to send you the ad here or on discord
someguy_matt: would love to see your live reaction to ti as someone who enjoyed XV too
MR_CRASH87: I never had them before
SeeFooBoo: grab shell?
MR_CRASH87: This is very confusing

history83: I dont see what you need to do here
SeeFooBoo: can you drop the square block on the left?
someguy_matt: this is not what the game is like btw
SeeFooBoo: this doesn't help
someguy_matt: i get ads like this for zombie games all the time on tiktok
someguy_matt: imagine my surprise when Noctis and Luna are in it for some reason
SeeFooBoo: it may be misleading you may just need to go fast
SeeFooBoo: woah
history83: oh ok can you pick him up again?
SeeFooBoo: drop it ther
SeeFooBoo: drop it before he kicks i think for consistency
history83: so close
SeeFooBoo: the block
SeeFooBoo: drop the block before the second koopa kicks the shell
SeeFooBoo: drop the shell, run right, pickup the block, drop hit switch before the kick happens
savagehenre: heard great things about this hack
savagehenre: relaxing with some bud
SeeFooBoo: I mean do your thing, hopefully I'm not backseating too much

someguy_matt: but he's fudging the truth to make him seem cooler
history83: yes I finished the first season
someguy_matt: when you talk to his side kicks they're talking shit about how he's lying and in actuality he's failing upward
history83: I didnt like him at first but he kind of grew on me towards the end
shakadactyl: Oh, I haven’t watched anime in a long time. Ah, I lie. I’ve been rewatching Princess Tutu with my sister and niece.

jellyfish_trifle: I've just finished Frankenstein and started "So you've been publicly shamed"
SayYestotheJes: omg Frankenstein was my fave book I ever had to read for school, and So You've Been Publicly Shamed is V INTERESTING!!!!
jellyfish_trifle: It's a non-fiction by Jon Ronson. It's basically about "cancel culture" before that was a thing.
Snoreslax: i think if the moving shell is going right the stationary will fall right and vice versa
jellyfish_trifle: Like how normal people's lives can be hugely impacted because they do something wwrong and the internet goes crazy over it
Snoreslax: so the past few times youve been hitting it on the bounce off the wall
Snoreslax: and the first time you had it right in the corner

jellyfish_trifle: 5 deep? You flew too close to the sun, Shaun.
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @jellyfish_trifle I figured I had to go for 5 since slowmode was on Kappa
EyeOdin: I just recieved Cd0h's  notice for her stream LUL
ratatremy: Doing good. Pretty tired tho
ratatremy: I had jury duty selection today LUL
EyeOdin: it was on discord there is something happening wrong there. I never get there in time
Shaun_Da_Bomb: @ratatremy dang lucky! Lol Ive only ever had like the first step in that process
EyeOdin: not me
navysquirrel: i had jury duty last month
e_mcsqrd: I'm exempt!!
history83: I have not had to do jury duty yet thank goodness
SayYestotheJes: i got picked once but i was released because my brother is in prison LUL so i didn't have to do it
MR_CRASH87: i was selected but when i got there they sent me home
EyeOdin: in my country there is no jury duty I think
ratatremy: I made it to the next round. It’s like March Madness 😈
MR_CRASH87: they said i didnt have to stay there so i said thank you goodbye LUL
e_mcsqrd: While I'm academic, I also work in medical and i'm one of the listed exempt groups
SayYestotheJes: i'm rooting for you @ratatremy i have you winning my jury duty bracket
EyeOdin: doctors are importante for society?
EyeOdin: I guess
GiganticBucket: I got out of grand jury duty as a dev on a small team because our CFO & CTO wrote a letter requesting exemption LUL
e_mcsqrd: I think it takes us away from patients and stuff ?
e_mcsqrd: I wish i had a better answer...but I won't complain lol
history83: yea grand jury is like 5 days long even if you dont get selected
a_n_i_v: well it might mean all four answers get said in 5 seconds?
GiganticBucket: grand jury duty for us was like 2 days a week for 3 months, no matter what
e_mcsqrd: you can have a bench warrant out for you. i think it's an offense
ratatremy: You just get called back like three months later LUL
MR_CRASH87: i think you go to jail or get fined if you dont go
SayYestotheJes: yeah you can be in contempt of court if you don't show
yoshi_lover_: Ready to be blown
GiganticBucket: They don't have that power, but the judge/prosecutor agreed to it (but looked disappointed in me LUL )
e_mcsqrd: if you fail to attend court when you're requested to do so
jellyfish_trifle: @GiganticBucket That'd be a cool setting for a movie or book. A bunch of strangers continuing to go about their lives but thrown together twice per week for months. Then they go their separate ways forever.
MR_CRASH87: don't quote me on that LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
SSVick: So if my name was Toad_lover_ would you put the shower cap?
yoshi_lover_: Duuuuuude.  Dooooooope.
Snoreslax: it depends on your county here in the states, ive definitely dodged jury duty twice
Snoreslax: and no warrant luckily
SSVick: LUL
EyeOdin: I mean you can recieve mail BUT if you dont have mail how can you recieve it even?
MetalCrazy666: I did not hear it
Snoreslax: i show up and sign out on a smoker sheet
SayYestotheJes: my hope is that i am now on a blacklist for jury duty tbh LUL
Snoreslax: they never call and i never come back
jellyfish_trifle: !plant
GiganticBucket: @jellyfish_trifle Until mysterious circumstances 10 years later reunite them one last time...
yoshi_lover_: Mainly just watch.  Played Learn2Kaizo about 5 years ago.  Got stuck on the double shell jump and decided to take a break.  Still on break.
MetalCrazy666: NODDERS
MR_CRASH87: !plant
history83: !plant
MR_CRASH87: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
history83: that is horse shit

MR_CRASH87: I currently use my sisters HBO MAX account
betterCallSalt_: oh yo, we can be the micro weenie warriors
history83: oh dang I missed it ok
Ginger_Tech_: Wait, Aniv subs to you? Damn. LUL
baddiebec: Is Aniv losing his mind here..?
betterCallSalt_: @baddiebec never had one
jellyfish_trifle: I like to think aniv is working on some serious problems and just has stream on in the background. Then he jumps in from time to time to get our help on points.
ShadowPandaaaa: did you say age of empires?
MinisterGold: like its easy to know what you did wrong i guess?
SuperCaptainRob: Learning to play an RTS competitively is brutal
MinisterGold: oh man
MinisterGold: yea when you fuck up in Smash, you find out in a few seconds... haha
SuperCaptainRob: In college I tried to work my way up the ladder in Starcraft 2.  I never made it past the bottom of Silver
betterCallSalt_: StinkyCheese
SuperCaptainRob: Professional Star Craft is really fun to watch though.  The players are insane
betterCallSalt_: grinding kaizo > grinding RTS -Nik
MinisterGold: so are you giving up on playing AOE competitively then
MinisterGold: well... i get the feeling you like halo a lot and are good at it
SuperCaptainRob: Part of what I found frustrating with RTS multiplayer is that I really like slowly building up resources in singleplayer but that playstyle is not possible in multiplayer.  You're gonna get crushed by an aggro strat every time
jellyfish_trifle: Did you hit diamond in a previous season of Halo?
MinisterGold: that's fair
MR_CRASH87: I’m into halo
MinisterGold: and your friends only want to play it competitively?
MR_CRASH87: No LUL
SuperCaptainRob: There is a difference but it can be stubtle.  I'd say an aggro strat is able to keep going if the initial assault gets repelled, whereas a cheese strat is going to be a low skill all in which fails if the initial attack fails
MinisterGold: Hmm...do you have time to just split between the two or is that too much to grind
anotherMrEllis: its not cheese if it works
MinisterGold: so what if you were okay at being mediocre or growing slower in AOE
anotherMrEllis: just pick the spartan army in AOE, then its like you're playing both games anothe40Shrug
MinisterGold: okay with*
MinisterGold: yup i agree with that
MinisterGold: yea for sure
anotherMrEllis: just play whats fun none of us are hitting the top of the ladder anyway :P
MinisterGold: haha
betterCallSalt_: I used to think that Ellis, until I worked with someone who was literal top of ladder in a game. like, just outside of professional. nothing made me feel worse about my skills LUL
MR_CRASH87: That’s why I said this levels blows man LUL
betterCallSalt_: rocket league
SuperCaptainRob: I used to try and climb ladder in competitive (Hearthstone, Overwatch, League), but eventually I realized that I was making myself miserable.  There are people who like that grind, for me I get hooked on that grind, but I don't have fun.
MR_CRASH87: Bro I’m having the time of my life cause of you dude 💯😎
betterCallSalt_: this level sucks and it ain't your fault, nik
betterCallSalt_: overwatch 2 makes me feel like a viewer sometimes
